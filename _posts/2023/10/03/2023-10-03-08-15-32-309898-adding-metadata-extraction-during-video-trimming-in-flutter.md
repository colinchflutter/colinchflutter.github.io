When working with video editing in a Flutter app, it is often necessary to extract metadata from the video files. Metadata contains information such as the duration, resolution, and frame rate of the video. This information can be used to enhance the user experience and provide valuable insights.

In this blog post, we will explore how to add metadata extraction during video trimming in a Flutter app. By following these steps, you will be able to extract and utilize video metadata seamlessly.

## Step 1: Import Required Packages

To begin, we need to import the necessary packages in our Flutter app. Add the following imports to your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_ffmpeg/flutter_ffmpeg.dart';
import 'package:ffmpeg_kit_flutter/ffmpeg_kit.dart';
```

The `flutter_ffmpeg` package provides an interface to invoke FFmpeg commands in Flutter, while `ffmpeg_kit_flutter` allows us to interact with FFmpeg using Flutter.

## Step 2: Set Up FFmpeg

We need to set up FFmpeg to utilize its video processing capabilities. Ensure that you have the FFmpeg binaries installed on your system.

## Step 3: Extract Metadata

Next, let's write a function to extract the metadata from the video file. The following code snippet demonstrates how to do this:

```dart
Future<void> extractMetadata(String inputFilePath) async {
  final ffmpeg = FlutterFFmpeg();
  final infoCommand = "-i $inputFilePath";

  return await ffmpeg.execute(infoCommand).then((rc) {
    print("FFmpeg process exited with rc $rc");
  });
}
```

In this code, we create an instance of `FlutterFFmpeg` to execute FFmpeg commands. We then pass the `infoCommand` to FFmpeg with the input video file path. FFmpeg will extract the metadata and return the result in the console output.

## Step 4: Trim Video with Extracted Metadata

Now, let's combine the metadata extraction with video trimming. We can use the extracted metadata to determine the video's duration and set the start and end timestamps for video trimming. Here's an example:

```dart
Future<void> trimVideo(String inputFilePath, String outputFilePath,
    int startTimestamp, int endTimestamp) async {
  final ffmpeg = FlutterFFmpeg();
  final trimCommand =
      "-i $inputFilePath -ss $startTimestamp -to $endTimestamp $outputFilePath";

  return await ffmpeg.execute(trimCommand).then((rc) {
    print("FFmpeg process exited with rc $rc");
  });
}
```

In this code, we pass the input file path, start timestamp, end timestamp, and output file path to FFmpeg. FFmpeg trims the video based on the provided timestamps and saves the trimmed video to the output file path.

## Step 5: Utilize Extracted Metadata

Now that we have the video's metadata and can trim it accordingly, we can utilize this information in our Flutter app. You can display the video duration, resolution, or other metadata to the user or use it for further processing.

```dart
final videoMetadata = await extractMetadata(inputFilePath);
print("Video duration: ${videoMetadata.duration}");
print("Video resolution: ${videoMetadata.resolution}");
```

By utilizing the extracted metadata, you can enhance the user experience and provide valuable information to the users.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to add metadata extraction during video trimming in a Flutter app. By following these steps, you should now be able to extract metadata from video files and use it to enhance your app's functionality. Taking advantage of video metadata can provide a more dynamic and engaging user experience. So go ahead and try it out in your Flutter video editing app!
