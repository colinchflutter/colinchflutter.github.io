Panoramic videos provide an immersive viewing experience, capturing a wider perspective of the scene. However, due to their unique aspect ratio, commonly used video editing features may not work as expected. In this blog post, we will explore how to create a video trimming feature specifically tailored for panoramic videos in Flutter.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following:

- Flutter SDK installed
- An IDE of your choice (e.g., Android Studio, Visual Studio Code)
- Basic understanding of Flutter and Dart programming

## Getting Started
Let's start by creating a new Flutter project. Open your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

```flutter create panoramic_video_trimming```

This command will generate a new Flutter project with the name "panoramic_video_trimming".

Next, navigate to the project directory:

```cd panoramic_video_trimming```

Open the project in your preferred IDE.

## Integrating Video Trimming Library
We will be using the **video_trim** library to enable video trimming functionality in our app. Add the following dependency to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  video_trim: ^1.0.2
```

Save the file and run the following command to fetch the new dependency:

```flutter pub get```

## Implementing Video Trimming
Now, let's create a new Flutter widget that will serve as the main screen for our video trimming feature. Inside the `lib` folder, create a new file called `video_trimming_screen.dart`.

Add the following code to `video_trimming_screen.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_trim/video_trim.dart';

class VideoTrimmingScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoTrimmingScreenState createState() => _VideoTrimmingScreenState();
}

class _VideoTrimmingScreenState extends State<VideoTrimmingScreen> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Video Trimming"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RaisedButton(
          onPressed: _trimVideo,
          child: Text("Trim Video"),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void _trimVideo() {
    // Code to open video trimming interface
  }
}
```

This code sets up the basic structure for our video trimming screen. It includes an app bar with the title "Video Trimming" and a button that will trigger the video trimming process.

Inside the `_trimVideo()` method, we will implement the logic to open the video trimming interface using the **video_trim** library.

## Opening the Video Trimming Interface
To open the video trimming interface, we will use the `VideoTrimming.createTrimmedVideo()` method provided by the **video_trim** library.

Modify the `_trimVideo()` method as follows:

```dart
void _trimVideo() async {
  final videoPath = 'path_to_your_panoramic_video.mp4';

  final trimmedVideoPath = await VideoTrimming.createTrimmedVideo(
    context: context,
    video: videoPath,
  );

  if (trimmedVideoPath != null) {
    // Code to handle the trimmed video path
  }
}
```

Replace `'path_to_your_panoramic_video.mp4'` with the actual path to your panoramic video file. The `VideoTrimming.createTrimmedVideo()` method takes the `context` and `video` parameters. It displays the video trimming interface and returns the path of the trimmed video.

Now, when the user taps the "Trim Video" button, the video trimming interface will open, allowing them to select and trim the desired portion of the panoramic video.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we learned how to create a video trimming feature specifically tailored for panoramic videos in Flutter. By integrating the **video_trim** library and implementing the necessary logic, we can provide a seamless video editing experience for panoramic videos. This feature can be further enhanced by adding additional editing options and functionalities.

Get creative and experiment with different techniques to develop a robust video trimming feature for your Flutter app!
