In this tutorial, we will explore how to add automatic video trimming in a Flutter application using scene detection. Scene detection is the process of automatically finding the boundaries between different scenes in a video. By leveraging scene detection, we can identify the start and end points of each scene and use that information to trim the video accordingly.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Android Studio)
- Basic knowledge of Flutter and Dart programming language

## Getting Started

1. Create a new Flutter project by running the following command in your terminal:
```shell
flutter create video_trimming_app
```

2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.

3. Add the `video_player` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_player: ^2.2.5
```

4. Run the following command to fetch the package:

```shell
flutter pub get
```

## Implementing Scene Detection

To implement scene detection in Flutter, we will make use of the `video_player` package and a scene detection library. For this tutorial, we will use the `ffmpeg` library for scene detection.

### 1. Add the `flutter_ffmpeg` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_player: ^2.2.5
  flutter_ffmpeg: ^0.4.0
```

### 2. Run the following command to fetch the package:

```shell
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Import the necessary libraries in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ffmpeg/flutter_ffmpeg.dart';
```

### 4. Implement the scene detection logic:

```dart
void detectScenes(String videoPath) async {
  final FlutterFFmpeg _flutterFFmpeg = new FlutterFFmpeg();

  await _flutterFFmpeg.execute(
    '-i $videoPath -vf "select=gt(scene\\,0.4),showinfo" -f null -',
  ).then((rc) {
    print('FFmpeg process exited with rc $rc');
  });
}
```

In the code above, we use the `FlutterFFmpeg` instance to execute an FFmpeg command that performs scene detection on the specified video file. The `-vf` option applies a filter to select scenes with a difference greater than 0.4 and also displays the resulting information.

### 5. Invoke the scene detection method when needed:

```dart
detectScenes('path_to_your_video.mp4');
```

Replace `'path_to_your_video.mp4'` with the actual path to your video file.

## Trimming the Video

Once we have detected the start and end points of each scene, we can proceed to trim the video accordingly. In this example, we will use the `video_player` package to play and trim the video.

### 1. Import the necessary libraries:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';
```

### 2. Create a `VideoPlayerController` instance:

```dart
final VideoPlayerController _controller = VideoPlayerController.asset(
  'path_to_your_video.mp4',
);
```

Replace `'path_to_your_video.mp4'` with the actual path to your video file.

### 3. Initialize the controller and add a listener:

```dart
_controller.initialize().then((value) {
  setState(() {});
  _controller.addListener(() {
    if (_controller.value.position >= endScene) {
      _controller.pause();
    }
  });
});
```

In the code above, we initialize the controller and add a listener to check if the current video position exceeds the end of the scene. If it does, we pause the video.

### 4. Trim the video based on scene detection data:

```dart
_controller.seekTo(startScene);
```

Replace `startScene` with the start position of the scene.

### 5. Play the trimmed video:

```dart
_controller.play();
```

### 6. Dispose of the controller when the video is no longer needed:

```dart
_controller.dispose();
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to add automatic video trimming based on scene detection in a Flutter application. By leveraging the `video_player` package and the `flutter_ffmpeg` library, we were able to detect scenes in a video and trim it accordingly. This can be useful in applications that require automated video editing or scene extraction.

Make sure to optimize the scene detection algorithm and fine-tune the threshold values based on your specific use case to achieve accurate results.
