In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement a multi-video trimming feature in Flutter. This feature will allow users to select multiple videos and trim them to a specified duration.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have installed the following prerequisites:

- Flutter SDK
- Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development)

## Steps

1. **Add video trimming library**: To implement video trimming functionality, we will use the `video_trimmer` package. Open your project's `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     video_trimmer: ^2.0.0
   ```

   Then, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

2. **Select and trim videos**: Create a new Flutter screen to handle video selection and trimming. Use the `video_trimmer` package to allow users to select multiple videos and trim them to the desired duration. Here's an example of how to implement the selection and trimming logic:

   ```dart
   import 'package:video_trimmer/video_trimmer.dart';

   class MultiVideoTrimmingScreen extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _MultiVideoTrimmingScreenState createState() =>
         _MultiVideoTrimmingScreenState();
   }

   class _MultiVideoTrimmingScreenState extends State<MultiVideoTrimmingScreen> {
     Trimmer _trimmer = Trimmer();
     List<String> selectedVideos = [];

     Future<void> _selectVideos() async {
       // Implement video selection logic here
     }

     Future<void> _trimVideos() async {
       for (String videoPath in selectedVideos) {
         await _trimmer.loadVideo(videoFile: File(videoPath));
         final editedVideo = await _trimmer.trim(
           startTrimPosition: Duration(seconds: 5),
           endTrimPosition: Duration(seconds: 15),
         );

         // Save the trimmed video or perform further processing
       }
     }
     
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(
           title: Text('Multi-video Trimming'),
         ),
         body: Center(
           child: Column(
             mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
             children: [
               ElevatedButton(
                 onPressed: _selectVideos,
                 child: Text('Select Videos'),
               ),
               ElevatedButton(
                 onPressed: _trimVideos,
                 child: Text('Trim Videos'),
               ),
             ],
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Integrate the multi-video trimming screen**: Once you have implemented the multi-video trimming logic, integrate the `MultiVideoTrimmingScreen` into your Flutter app as desired. You can navigate to this screen from other parts of your app where video trimming is required.

   ```dart
   class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return MaterialApp(
         title: 'Video Trimming App',
         theme: ThemeData(
           primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
         ),
         home: MultiVideoTrimmingScreen(),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a multi-video trimming feature in Flutter using the `video_trimmer` package. By following the steps outlined above, you can allow users to select multiple videos, trim them according to specified durations, and perform further processing as necessary.
