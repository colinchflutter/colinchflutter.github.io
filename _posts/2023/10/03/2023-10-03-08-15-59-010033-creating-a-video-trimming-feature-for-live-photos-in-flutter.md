Live photos have become increasingly popular as they capture a few seconds of video along with the still image. However, sometimes we may want to trim and extract only a specific portion of the live photo's video. In this blog post, we will explore how to create a video trimming feature for live photos in Flutter.

## Installing Dependencies

Before we start, let's make sure we have all the necessary dependencies. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_ffmpeg: ^0.4.0
```

The `flutter_ffmpeg` package provides an easy way to manipulate video files in Flutter using FFmpeg commands.

## Trimming the Video

To trim the video portion of a live photo, we first need to extract and save the video file from the live photo. We can use the `flutter_ffmpeg` package to execute FFmpeg commands in our Flutter app.

First, copy the live photo file to a temporary directory using the `path_provider` package:

```dart
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
import 'dart:io';

final tempDir = await getTemporaryDirectory();
final videoPath = '${tempDir.path}/trimmed_video.mp4';
final livePhotoPath = 'path_to_live_photo.mov';  // Replace with the actual live photo path

await File(livePhotoPath).copy(videoPath);
```

Next, we can use FFmpeg to trim the video using the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_ffmpeg/flutter_ffmpeg.dart';

final ffmpeg = FlutterFFmpeg();

// Define the start and end time of the trim
final startTime = '00:02:00.00';  // Replace with the desired start time
final endTime = '00:02:10.00';  // Replace with the desired end time

// Execute FFmpeg command to trim the video
final command = '-i $videoPath -ss $startTime -to $endTime -c:v copy -c:a copy ${tempDir.path}/trimmed_output.mp4';
final returnCode = await ffmpeg.execute(command);

if (returnCode == 0) {
  // Video trimming successful
} else {
  // Video trimming failed
}
```

In the above code, we define the start and end times in `HH:MM:SS.MS` format. The `-ss` option specifies the start time, `-to` option specifies the end time, and `-c:v copy -c:a copy` ensures that both the video and audio codecs remain the same.

After executing the FFmpeg command, check the return code to determine if the video trimming was successful.

## Displaying the Trimmed Video

Once the video trimming is complete, you can display the trimmed video using a video player widget like `chewie` or `video_player`.

```dart
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';

final trimmedVideoPath = '${tempDir.path}/trimmed_output.mp4';

final videoPlayerController = VideoPlayerController.file(File(trimmedVideoPath));
await videoPlayerController.initialize();

// Display the video player widget
VideoPlayer(videoPlayerController);
```

Replace `VideoPlayer` with the appropriate video player widget you are using in your Flutter project.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a video trimming feature for live photos in Flutter. By leveraging the `flutter_ffmpeg` package, we were able to easily trim the video portion of a live photo using FFmpeg commands. Remember to handle edge cases, such as checking if the live photo contains video before attempting to trim it. Happy trimming!
