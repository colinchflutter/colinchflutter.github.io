Flutter is a popular framework for building cross-platform applications. It provides a rich set of features and allows developers to create unique and interactive user interfaces. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement real-time video trimming in Flutter, allowing users to select and trim specific portions of a video.

## Why do we need real-time video trimming?

Video trimming is a common requirement in many video editing applications. It allows users to remove unwanted sections from a video and keep only the essential parts. Real-time trimming, as opposed to offline trimming, enables users to preview and adjust the trim in real-time, making the editing process more efficient and user-friendly.

## Getting started

To implement real-time video trimming in Flutter, we can leverage the **video_player** package, which provides a powerful video player widget for playing videos in Flutter. Additionally, we will use the **flutterspinner** package for rendering the video timeline and trim controls.

First, let's add the required dependencies to our `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  video_player: ^2.1.0
  flutterspinner: ^0.1.0
```

Next, we need to import the necessary packages in our Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';
import 'package:flutterspinner/flutterspinner.dart';
```

## Building the video player widget

To display and control the video playback, we can create a custom `VideoPlayerWidget` widget. This widget will utilize the `video_player` package to handle the video playback functionality. Here's an example implementation:

```dart
class VideoPlayerWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  final String videoUrl;

  const VideoPlayerWidget({required this.videoUrl});

  @override
  _VideoPlayerWidgetState createState() => _VideoPlayerWidgetState();
}

class _VideoPlayerWidgetState extends State<VideoPlayerWidget> {
  late VideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = VideoPlayerController.network(widget.videoUrl)
      ..initialize().then((_) {
        setState(() {});
      });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    super.dispose();
    _controller.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    if (_controller.value.isInitialized) {
      return AspectRatio(
        aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
        child: VideoPlayer(_controller),
      );
    } else {
      return CircularProgressIndicator(); // Show loading indicator
    }
  }
}
```

## Adding video trimming functionality

Now that we have the video player widget, let's add the video trimming functionality. We will use the `flutterspinner` package to render the video timeline and trim controls.

```dart
class VideoTrimmingScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final String videoUrl;

  const VideoTrimmingScreen({required this.videoUrl});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Trimming'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          VideoPlayerWidget(videoUrl: videoUrl),
          FlutterSpinner(
            height: 50,
            thumbSize: 10,
            min: 0,
            max: 100,
            onValueChanged: (value) {
              // Handle the trim value change
              debugPrint('New trim value: $value');
            },
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // Save the trimmed video
              debugPrint('Saving trimmed video...');
            },
            child: Text('Save'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to implement real-time video trimming in Flutter. We started by setting up the necessary dependencies and then built a custom video player widget using the `video_player` package. Finally, we added the video trimming functionality using the `flutterspinner` package.

Real-time video trimming can greatly enhance the user experience in video editing applications. With Flutter's flexibility and powerful packages, implementing such features becomes more accessible for developers. Happy coding!
