In multimedia applications, video editing is a crucial feature. One common requirement is to provide users the ability to split a video into multiple clips during the trimming process. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement video splitting functionality during trimming using Flutter, a popular UI toolkit for building cross-platform applications.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following:

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine
- A code editor (such as Visual Studio Code or Android Studio) with the Flutter extension installed

## Splitting Videos in Flutter
To implement video splitting functionality during trimming, we will utilize the `video_player` package and the `ffmpeg` command-line tool, which is capable of manipulating videos.

### Step 1: Set up the Flutter project
Create a new Flutter project using the Flutter CLI command:

```
$ flutter create video_splitting_demo
```

Change your working directory to the project folder:

```
$ cd video_splitting_demo
```

### Step 2: Add required dependencies
Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_player: ^2.1.11
  path_provider: ^2.2.2
  file_picker: ^4.2.0
```

Save the file and run the following command to fetch the dependencies:

```
$ flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Implement video trimming and splitting functionality
In this step, we will create a Flutter widget that allows users to trim and split videos.

First, create a new Dart file called `video_editor.dart`. Import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:io';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
import 'package:file_picker/file_picker.dart';
```

Next, define the `VideoEditor` class, which extends `StatefulWidget`.

```dart
class VideoEditor extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoEditorState createState() => _VideoEditorState();
}
```

Inside the `_VideoEditorState` class, declare the required variables and initialize the `VideoPlayerController`:

```dart
class _VideoEditorState extends State<VideoEditor> {
  VideoPlayerController _videoPlayerController;

  // Other variables
  // ...
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    _videoPlayerController = VideoPlayerController.network('YOUR_VIDEO_URL');
    _videoPlayerController.initialize().then((_) {
      setState(() {});
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    super.dispose();
    _videoPlayerController.dispose();
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Widget tree
    // ...
  }
}
```

Next, implement the video trimming and splitting functionality within the `build` method. You can use the `RangeSlider` widget to allow users to select the desired video range. Add buttons for trimming and splitting:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('Video Editor'),
    ),
    body: Column(
      children: [
        _videoPlayerController.value.isInitialized
            ? AspectRatio(
                aspectRatio: _videoPlayerController.value.aspectRatio,
                child: VideoPlayer(_videoPlayerController),
              )
            : Container(),
        SizedBox(height: 20.0),
        Row(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _pickVideo,
              child: Text('Pick Video'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _trimVideo,
              child: Text('Trim Video'),
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _splitVideo,
              child: Text('Split Video'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```

Finally, implement the `_pickVideo`, `_trimVideo`, and `_splitVideo` methods to handle user interactions:

```dart
void _pickVideo() async {
  FilePickerResult result = await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles(
    type: FileType.video,
    allowMultiple: false,
  );

  if (result != null) {
    File file = File(result.files.single.path);
    _videoPlayerController = VideoPlayerController.file(file);
    _videoPlayerController.initialize().then((_) {
      setState(() {});
    });
  }
}

Future<void> _trimVideo() async {
  // Implement video trimming logic here
}

Future<void> _splitVideo() async {
  // Implement video splitting logic here
}
```

### Step 4: Add ffmpeg dependency and execute commands
To split the video, we need to use the `ffmpeg` command-line tool. We can use the `flutter_ffmpeg` package to interact with the `ffmpeg` tool from within our Flutter app.

Add the `flutter_ffmpeg` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  flutter_ffmpeg: ^0.4.1
```

After saving the file, run the following command to fetch the dependency:

```
$ flutter pub get
```

Now, you can use the `flutter_ffmpeg` package to execute `ffmpeg` commands, such as splitting the video. Refer to the package documentation for more information on how to use it.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we explored how to add video splitting functionality during trimming using Flutter. We leveraged the `video_player` package for video playback and the `ffmpeg` command-line tool for video manipulation. By implementing the steps mentioned above, you can create a powerful video editing feature in your Flutter application.
