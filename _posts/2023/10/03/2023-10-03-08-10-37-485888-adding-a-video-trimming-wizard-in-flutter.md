Video editing has become a popular feature in many mobile applications. The ability to trim and modify videos allows users to create personalized content. In this blog post, we will explore how to add a video trimming wizard in Flutter, a powerful cross-platform framework.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can follow the official [installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) if you haven't set it up yet. Additionally, you'll need to have basic knowledge of Dart and Flutter concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started, create a new Flutter project and open it in your favorite editor. We'll be using the `video_player` and `flutter_ffmpeg` plugins to achieve video trimming functionality.

## Installing Required Plugins

To install the required plugins, add the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  video_player: ^2.2.5
  flutter_ffmpeg: ^0.4.0
```

Then, run the command `flutter pub get` to fetch and install the dependencies.

## Implementing the Video Trimming Wizard

#### 1. Import Required Libraries

In your Dart file, import the necessary libraries:

```dart
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ffmpeg/flutter_ffmpeg.dart';
```

#### 2. Initialize Video Player

Create an instance of the `VideoPlayerController` and wrap it inside a `VideoPlayer` widget to display the video:

```dart
VideoPlayerController _controller;

...

_controller = VideoPlayerController.file(File(videoPath))
  ..initialize().then((_) {
    setState(() {});
    _controller.play();
  });

...

VideoPlayer(_controller)
```

#### 3. Add Trim Functionality

Now, let's add the ability to trim the video. We'll define two variables to hold the start and end positions of the selected portion:

```dart
Duration _startPosition = Duration.zero;
Duration _endPosition = Duration.zero;
```

To set the start position, you can use a draggable widget that modifies the `_startPosition` variable:

```dart
GestureDetector(
  onPanUpdate: (details) {
    setState(() {
      _startPosition += Duration(milliseconds: details.delta.dx.round());
    });
  },
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.red,
    width: 20,
    height: 100,
  ),
)
```

Similarly, you can add a draggable widget to modify the `_endPosition` variable for the end position.

#### 4. Trim the Video

To trim the video using `flutter_ffmpeg`, use the following code within a button's `onPressed` callback:

```dart
void _trimVideo() async {
  try {
    final FlutterFFmpeg _flutterFFmpeg = FlutterFFmpeg();
    await _flutterFFmpeg.execute(
      '-i $videoPath -ss $_startPosition -t ${_endPosition - _startPosition} -async 1 $trimmedVideoPath',
    );
  } catch (error) {
    print('Video trimming failed: $error');
  }
}
```

This code uses the `execute` method from `flutter_ffmpeg` to trim the video based on the start and end positions. The output video will be saved to a specified location (`trimmedVideoPath`).

#### 5. Display Trimmed Video

To display the trimmed video, create a new instance of `VideoPlayerController` and initialize it with the trimmed video path:

```dart
VideoPlayerController _trimmedController;

...

_trimmedController = VideoPlayerController.file(File(trimmedVideoPath))
  ..initialize().then((_) {
    setState(() {});
    _trimmedController.play();
  });

...

VideoPlayer(_trimmedController)
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented a video trimming wizard in Flutter. Users can now select a specific portion of a video and trim it to their desired length. This functionality can be extended to create more advanced video editing features in your Flutter applications.
