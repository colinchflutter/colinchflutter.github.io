In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of adding a video trimming control panel in a Flutter application. This control panel will allow users to trim and cut videos to specific lengths.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the Flutter SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Flutter website: [https://flutter.dev/](https://flutter.dev/)

## Steps

### Step 1: Initialize a Flutter Project

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your desired directory.
2. Run the following command to create a new Flutter project:

   ```
   flutter create video_trimmer
   ```

3. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```
   cd video_trimmer
   ```

### Step 2: Add Dependencies

1. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file in your project and add the following dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     video_player: ^2.2.5
     trimmer: ^1.1.0
   ```

2. Save the file and run the following command to fetch the newly added dependencies:

   ```
   flutter packages get
   ```

### Step 3: Create the Control Panel Widget

1. In the `lib` directory of your project, create a new file called `video_control_panel.dart`.

2. Open the `video_control_panel.dart` file and add the following code:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:trimmer/trimmer.dart';

   class VideoControlPanel extends StatefulWidget {
     final Trimmer trimmer;
     // Add any additional required properties

     VideoControlPanel({required this.trimmer});

     @override
     _VideoControlPanelState createState() => _VideoControlPanelState();
   }

   class _VideoControlPanelState extends State<VideoControlPanel> {
     // Add your implementation
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Container(
         // Build your control panel UI here
       );
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 4: Implement the Control Panel UI

1. Within the `_VideoControlPanelState` class, implement the control panel UI using Flutter widgets according to your specific design requirements.

2. Add any necessary functionality to the control panel, such as buttons for trimming and saving the video.

### Step 5: Use the VideoControlPanel Widget

1. Open the `main.dart` file in the `lib` directory of your project.

2. Replace the existing code with the following code:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:video_trimmer/video_control_panel.dart';
   import 'package:trimmer/trimmer.dart';

   void main() {
     runApp(MyApp());
   }

   class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return MaterialApp(
         title: 'Video Trimmer',
         home: Scaffold(
           appBar: AppBar(
             title: Text('Video Trimmer'),
           ),
           body: Center(
             child: VideoControlPanel(trimmer: Trimmer()),
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 6: Test the Application

1. Save all the changes and run the application using the following command:

   ```
   flutter run
   ```

2. Verify that the video trimming control panel is displayed correctly in the application.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully added a video trimming control panel in your Flutter application. Now you can allow users to trim and cut videos to specific lengths with ease. Happy coding!
