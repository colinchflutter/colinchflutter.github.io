Flutter is a powerful framework that allows developers to create cross-platform applications with ease. One common use case is video editing, where developers may need to implement batch processing for trimming multiple videos at once. In this blog post, we will explore how to add batch processing for video trimming in Flutter.

## Getting Started

Before we begin, please ensure that you have Flutter and Dart installed on your development machine. You can refer to the [official Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for installation instructions.

## Installing Dependencies

To enable video trimming in Flutter, we need to use a third-party package called `video_trimmer`. Open your project's `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_trimmer: ^2.2.0
```

Remember to run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to fetch the package and update your project.

## Implementing Video Trimming

To trim a single video file in Flutter, we can follow the instructions provided in the `video_trimmer` package documentation. However, to enable batch processing, we need to modify the implementation slightly.

First, let's create a list of video file paths that we want to trim:

```dart
List<String> videoPaths = [
  'path/to/video1.mp4',
  'path/to/video2.mp4',
  // Add more video paths here
];
```

Next, we need to loop through the list of video paths and trim each video individually:

```dart
import 'package:video_trimmer/video_trimmer.dart';

Future<void> trimVideos(List<String> videoPaths) async {
  final _trimmer = Trimmer();

  for (final path in videoPaths) {
    await _trimmer.loadVideo(videoFile: File(path));
  
    final trimmedVideoPath = await _trimmer.trimVideo(
      startValue: Duration(seconds: 5),   // Specify start time for trimming
      endValue: Duration(seconds: 10),    // Specify end time for trimming
    );

    // Do something with the trimmed video path, like saving it to a new file or uploading to a server
  }

  _trimmer.dispose();
}
```

Make sure to handle any errors that may occur during the trimming process and clean up after each iteration.

## Running Batch Processing

To execute the batch processing of video trimming, simply call the `trimVideos` function and pass in the list of video paths:

```dart
trimVideos(videoPaths).then((_) {
  print('Batch video trimming completed');
}).catchError((error) {
  print('An error occurred during video trimming: $error');
});
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to add batch processing for video trimming in Flutter. By utilizing the `video_trimmer` package and writing a simple loop, we were able to trim multiple video files at once. Batch processing can save significant time and effort for video editing applications, making it a valuable feature to implement.

Remember, when working with batch processing, it's important to handle errors properly and optimize memory usage to ensure smooth performance.
