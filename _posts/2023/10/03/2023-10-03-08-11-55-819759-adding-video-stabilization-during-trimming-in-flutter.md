If you've ever worked with video editing in Flutter, you might have encountered the challenge of stabilizing shaky footage. Shaky videos can significantly reduce the quality and user experience of your app. In this blog post, we'll explore how to add video stabilization during the trimming process in Flutter.

## What is Video Stabilization?

Video stabilization is a technique used to reduce the shakiness and jitteriness often seen in handheld videos. It helps create smoother, more professional-looking videos by automatically compensating for camera movements and vibrations.

## Trimming and Stabilizing Videos in Flutter

To add video stabilization during the trimming process in Flutter, we can utilize the `flutter_ffmpeg` package. This package provides a Flutter plugin to process videos using FFmpeg, a powerful multimedia framework.

Here's an example code snippet to demonstrate how to perform video trimming and stabilization using `flutter_ffmpeg`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_ffmpeg/flutter_ffmpeg.dart';

void trimAndStabilizeVideo(String inputPath, String outputPath) async {
  final flutterFFmpeg = FlutterFFmpeg();

  await flutterFFmpeg.execute(
    "-i $inputPath -vf deshake -t 10 $outputPath",
  );
}
```

In the code above, we first import the `flutter_ffmpeg` package. Next, we define the `trimAndStabilizeVideo` function which takes an `inputPath` (path to the video file) and an `outputPath` (path to save the trimmed and stabilized video). Inside the function, we create an instance of `FlutterFFmpeg` and use it to execute the FFmpeg command.

The FFmpeg command `-i $inputPath -vf deshake -t 10 $outputPath` does the following:

- `-i $inputPath` specifies the input video file.
- `-vf deshake` applies video stabilization using the `deshake` filter.
- `-t 10` sets the duration of the output video to 10 seconds. You can adjust this value as per your requirements.
- `$outputPath` specifies the output path for the trimmed and stabilized video.

Make sure to include the necessary permissions in your Android and iOS projects to read and write videos.

## Conclusion

Adding video stabilization during the trimming process enhances the overall quality of videos in your Flutter app. By utilizing the `flutter_ffmpeg` package and the power of FFmpeg, you can easily implement this feature and provide your users with smoother, more enjoyable video content.
