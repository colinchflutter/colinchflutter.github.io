With the growing popularity of panoramic videos, it's important to have the capability to trim and edit them efficiently within your mobile applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to create a video trimming feature for panoramic videos using Flutter, the open-source UI toolkit.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the implementation, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Android Studio)
- Basic knowledge of Flutter and Dart programming language

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

To enable video trimming functionality, we need to use a package that provides the necessary tools. For this purpose, we can use the `video_player` and `flutter_ffmpeg` packages. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_player: ^2.2.6
  flutter_ffmpeg: ^0.4.0
```

Save the file and run `flutter pub get` in the terminal to install the dependencies.

## Step 2: Import Packages

In your Flutter project, open the Dart file where you want to implement the video trimming feature. Import the necessary packages using the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ffmpeg/flutter_ffmpeg.dart';
```

Now you have access to the `VideoPlayerController` from the `video_player` package and the `FFmpeg` class from the `flutter_ffmpeg` package.

## Step 3: Create a Video Trimming UI

In your Flutter widget, create a basic UI that provides the necessary controls for video trimming. You can use `Slider`, `IconButton`, and `VideoPlayer` widgets to control the trim duration. Optionally, you can include a preview pane to display the trimmed video. Here's an example UI:

```dart
class VideoTrimmerWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoTrimmerWidgetState createState() => _VideoTrimmerWidgetState();
}

class _VideoTrimmerWidgetState extends State<VideoTrimmerWidget> {
  final VideoPlayerController _controller = VideoPlayerController.network(
    'https://example.com/panoramic_video.mp4',
  );
  double _startValue = 0;
  double _endValue = 1;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller.initialize().then((_) {
      setState(() {});
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Trimmer'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          if (_controller.value.isInitialized)
            AspectRatio(
              aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
              child: VideoPlayer(_controller),
            ),
          Slider(
            value: _startValue,
            min: 0,
            max: _endValue,
            onChanged: (value) {
              setState(() {
                _startValue = value;
              });
            },
          ),
          Slider(
            value: _endValue,
            min: _startValue,
            max: 1,
            onChanged: (value) {
              setState(() {
                _endValue = value;
              });
            },
          ),
          Row(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              IconButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.trim_start),
                onPressed: _trimVideo,
              ),
              IconButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.trim_end),
                onPressed: _trimVideo,
              ),
            ],
          ),
          // Add video preview pane if necessary
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  void _trimVideo() {
    // Implement video trimming logic using flutter_ffmpeg package
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Implement Video Trimming Logic

In the `_trimVideo()` method, we will add the logic to trim the video based on the selected start and end values. To achieve this, we'll use the `FFmpeg` class from the `flutter_ffmpeg` package. Here's an example of how to implement video trimming logic:

```dart
void _trimVideo() async {
  final flutterFFmpeg = FlutterFFmpeg();
  final outputPath = '/path/to/trimmed_video.mp4';
  final start = (_controller.value.duration?.inMilliseconds ?? 0) * _startValue;
  final end = (_controller.value.duration?.inMilliseconds ?? 0) * _endValue;

  String command = '-i ${_controller.dataSource} -ss $start -to $end -c copy $outputPath';
  int returnCode = await flutterFFmpeg.execute(command);

  if (returnCode == 0) {
    // Trimmed video saved successfully
    // Perform further actions, such as displaying preview or playing the trimmed video
  } else {
    // Trimming failed, handle the error
  }
}
```

The `command` variable holds the FFmpeg command to trim the video. The start and end values are calculated based on the selected trim ranges. Replace `/path/to/trimmed_video.mp4` with your desired output file path.

## Step 5: Test the Video Trimming Feature

To test the video trimming feature, run your Flutter application on a device or simulator/emulator. Select the desired trim ranges using the sliders and click the corresponding trim buttons. The trimmed video will be saved to the specified output file path.

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented a video trimming feature for panoramic videos in Flutter. This powerful feature will allow users to edit their panoramic videos seamlessly within your application. Explore further possibilities by adding additional features such as video filters or transitions.
