In a multimedia application, it is often required to trim a video to a specific portion before displaying or manipulating it. However, just trimming the video is not always enough. Sometimes, we need to extract and display the metadata associated with the trimmed video as well. Flutter, being a versatile framework for building cross-platform applications, provides the necessary tools to achieve this functionality. In this blog post, we will explore how to add metadata extraction during video trimming in Flutter.

## Step 1: Import Required Packages

To get started, open your Flutter project and add the following packages to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_player: ^1.2.0
  flutter_ffmpeg: ^0.4.0
```

## Step 2: Trim the Video

Next, let's create a method to trim the video using the `flutter_ffmpeg` package. This package allows us to perform video editing operations in Flutter by leveraging the FFmpeg library.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_ffmpeg/flutter_ffmpeg.dart';

Future<void> trimVideo(String inputPath, String outputPath, int startTime, int endTime) async {
  final FlutterFFmpeg _flutterFFmpeg = FlutterFFmpeg();

  List<String> command = ['-y', '-i', inputPath, '-ss', startTime.toString(), '-to', endTime.toString(), '-c', 'copy', outputPath];
  
  await _flutterFFmpeg.executeWithArguments(command);
}
```

In the code snippet above, we create a method called `trimVideo` that takes in the `inputPath` of the video file, the `outputPath` of the trimmed video, and the `startTime` and `endTime` in milliseconds to specify the portion of the video to be trimmed. The `flutter_ffmpeg` package is then used to execute the FFmpeg command to trim the video.

## Step 3: Extract Metadata

To extract metadata from the trimmed video, we will use the `video_player` package in Flutter. This package provides a `VideoPlayerController` that allows us to extract various metadata properties of a video file.

```dart
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';

Future<Map<String, dynamic>> extractMetadata(String videoPath) async {
  final VideoPlayerController _videoPlayerController = VideoPlayerController.file(File(videoPath));

  await _videoPlayerController.initialize();
  final Duration videoDuration = _videoPlayerController.value.duration;
  final int videoWidth = _videoPlayerController.value.size.width.toInt();
  final int videoHeight = _videoPlayerController.value.size.height.toInt();
  
  await _videoPlayerController.dispose();

  return {
    'duration': videoDuration.toString(),
    'width': videoWidth,
    'height': videoHeight,
  };
}
```

In the code snippet above, we create a method called `extractMetadata` that takes in the `videoPath` of the trimmed video. The `video_player` package is used to initialize a `VideoPlayerController` with the video file. We then extract the duration, width, and height properties from the video and return them in a map.

## Step 4: Implementing the Functionality

Now that we have our trimming and metadata extraction methods, let's implement them in a Flutter application. Here's an example implementation:

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Video Trimmer',
      home: VideoTrimmerPage(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoTrimmerPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoTrimmerPageState createState() => _VideoTrimmerPageState();
}

class _VideoTrimmerPageState extends State<VideoTrimmerPage> {
  String videoPath = '';
  
  Future<void> trimAndExtractMetadata() async {
    final String inputPath = 'path/to/input/video.mp4';
    final String outputPath = 'path/to/output/trimmed_video.mp4';
    final int startTime = 0;
    final int endTime = 10000;

    await trimVideo(inputPath, outputPath, startTime, endTime);
    final metadata = await extractMetadata(outputPath);
    
    print(metadata);
    
    setState(() {
      videoPath = outputPath;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Trimmer'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: trimAndExtractMetadata,
              child: Text('Trim and Extract Metadata'),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            videoPath.isNotEmpty
                ? VideoPlayer(File(videoPath))  // Use video player widget from video_player package
                : Text('No video selected'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the example above, we create a Flutter application with a `VideoTrimmerPage` that contains a button to trigger the video trimming and metadata extraction process. The trimmed video is displayed using the `VideoPlayer` widget from the `video_player` package.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to add metadata extraction during video trimming in Flutter. We used the `flutter_ffmpeg` and `video_player` packages to trim the video and extract metadata, respectively. By following the steps outlined in this post, you can enhance your multimedia application by displaying essential information along with the trimmed video. Happy coding!
