In Flutter, you can create immersive video editing experiences by incorporating a progress notification while trimming videos. This allows users to accurately track the progress of their video trimming operation. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement a video trimming progress notification in Flutter.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can check if Flutter is installed by running the command `flutter --version` in your terminal.

## Implementing the Video Trimming Progress Notification

To begin, we need to create a Flutter project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
flutter create video_trimming_app
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd video_trimming_app
```

Next, we need to add the necessary dependencies. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following lines under the `dependencies` section:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_editor: ^1.0.0
```

Save the file and run the following command in your terminal to download the dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Once the dependencies are downloaded, open the `lib/main.dart` file and replace the existing code with the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_editor/video_editor.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(VideoTrimmingApp());
}

class VideoTrimmingApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Video Trimming App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: TrimmingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class TrimmingScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TrimmingScreenState createState() => _TrimmingScreenState();
}

class _TrimmingScreenState extends State<TrimmingScreen> {
  double _trimmingProgress = 0.0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    startTrimmingProcess();
  }

  void startTrimmingProcess() async {
    // Perform video trimming here
    for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
      await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 100));
      setState(() {
        _trimmingProgress = i / 100;
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Trimming'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            CircularProgressIndicator(
              value: _trimmingProgress,
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 16),
            Text(
              'Trimming Progress: ${(_trimmingProgress * 100).toStringAsFixed(2)}%',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we've created a simple Flutter app with a `TrimmingScreen` that shows the video trimming progress. The progress is simulated using a loop that updates the `_trimmingProgress` variable and calls `setState` to rebuild the UI.

To integrate your video trimming logic, replace the `startTrimmingProcess` method with your actual video trimming code. Update the progress value as your trimming process progresses.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented a video trimming progress notification in Flutter. This allows users to monitor the progress of their video trimming operations, providing a more engaging and interactive video editing experience. Utilize this approach to create powerful video editing apps by integrating additional features like cropping, transitions, and filters.

Remember to keep refining and optimizing your app for performance as video processing can be resource-intensive. Happy coding!
