Are you interested in learning how to trim videos in Flutter? Look no further! In this tutorial series, we will guide you through the process of creating a video trimming app using Flutter, a powerful UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Part 1: Setting Up the Project

In this first part, we will walk you through the initial setup required to start building the video trimming app.

### Step 1: Install Flutter

To get started, ensure that you have Flutter installed on your machine. If you haven't already installed Flutter, please follow the official Flutter installation guide for your operating system.

### Step 2: Create a New Flutter Project

Next, open your favorite IDE or text editor and create a new Flutter project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter create video_trimming_app
```

This will create a new Flutter project named "video_trimming_app" in the current directory.

### Step 3: Update 'pubspec.yaml' File

Once the project is created, open the `pubspec.yaml` file located in the root directory of your project. Add the following dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_player: ^2.1.5
  video_trimmer: ^2.1.0
```

Save the file and run the following command to fetch the dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 4: Create a New Flutter Screen

Now that the project is set up and dependencies are installed, let's create a new Flutter screen for the video trimming functionality. 

Open the `lib/main.dart` file and replace the existing code with the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(VideoTrimmingApp());
}

class VideoTrimmingApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Video Trimming App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: VideoTrimmingScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoTrimmingScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoTrimmingScreenState createState() => _VideoTrimmingScreenState();
}

class _VideoTrimmingScreenState extends State<VideoTrimmingScreen> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Trimming'),
      ),
      body: Container(
        child: Center(
          child: Text('Video Trimming Screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Save the file and run the following command to start the app:

```bash
flutter run
```

Congratulations! You have now set up the basic project structure for your video trimming app using Flutter.

Stay tuned for the next part of this tutorial series, where we will explore how to integrate video player and implement video trimming functionality.
