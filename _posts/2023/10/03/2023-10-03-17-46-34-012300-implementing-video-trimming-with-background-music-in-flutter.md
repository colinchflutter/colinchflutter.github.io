Video editing has become a popular feature in many mobile applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement video trimming with background music using Flutter. We will leverage the `video_player` package for video playback and the `flutter_ffmpeg` package for video processing.

## Prerequisites
Before we start, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You should also have a basic understanding of Flutter and how to create a new project.

## Setting up the Flutter project
To get started, create a new Flutter project by running the following command in your terminal:

```dart
flutter create video_trimming_with_music
```

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory:

```dart
cd video_trimming_with_music
```

## Adding dependencies
To use the `video_player` and `flutter_ffmpeg` packages, add the following lines to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_player: ^2.2.5
  flutter_ffmpeg: ^0.4.0
```

Next, fetch the dependencies by running the command:

```dart
flutter pub get
```

## Building the user interface
Let's start by creating a simple user interface that contains a video player widget, a trim bar, and playback controls.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';

class VideoTrimmingPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoTrimmingPageState createState() => _VideoTrimmingPageState();
}

class _VideoTrimmingPageState extends State<VideoTrimmingPage> {
  VideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = VideoPlayerController.asset('assets/sample_video.mp4')
      ..initialize().then((_) {
        // Add video playback and trimming logic here
      });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    super.dispose();
    _controller.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Trimming with Background Music'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          AspectRatio(
            aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
            child: VideoPlayer(_controller),
          ),
          // Add the trim bar and playback controls here
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Implementing video trimming
To implement video trimming, we will use the `flutter_ffmpeg` package. 

First, import the necessary classes:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_ffmpeg/flutter_ffmpeg.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ffmpeg/flutter_ffmpeg_config.dart';
```

Inside the `_VideoTrimmingPageState` class, add the following code to implement video trimming:

```dart
final FlutterFFmpeg _flutterFFmpeg = FlutterFFmpeg();

void _trimVideo() async {
  final String outputPath = '/path/to/output.mp4';
  final String inputPath = '/path/to/input.mp4';
  
  final String startTime = '00:00:05.000'; // Starting time of the trimmed video
  final String endTime = '00:00:10.000'; // Ending time of the trimmed video
  
  await _flutterFFmpeg.execute(
    '-i $inputPath -ss $startTime -to $endTime -c copy $outputPath',
  );

  // Add logic to play the trimmed video here
}
```

## Adding background music
To add background music to our video, we can use the `flutter_ffmpeg` package again. 

First, import the necessary classes:

```dart
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
import 'package:path/path.dart' as path;
```

Inside the `_VideoTrimmingPageState` class, add the following code to add background music:

```dart
final String musicPath = '/path/to/music.mp3';

void _addBackgroundMusic() async {
  final Directory tempDir = await getTemporaryDirectory();
  final String tempPath = tempDir.path;
  
  final String outputVideoPath = path.join(tempPath, 'output.mp4');
  final String outputAudioPath = path.join(tempPath, 'output_audio.mp3');
  final String outputPath = '/path/to/output_with_music.mp4';

  await _flutterFFmpeg.execute(
    '-i $outputVideoPath -i $musicPath -c copy -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 $outputPath',
  );

  // Add logic to play the final video with background music here
}
```

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we learned how to implement video trimming with background music in Flutter. We used the `video_player` package for video playback, and the `flutter_ffmpeg` package for video processing. By following this approach, you can enhance your Flutter applications with video editing capabilities.
