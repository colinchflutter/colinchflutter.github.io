In Flutter, motion tracking is a powerful technique that allows you to track the movement of objects within a video. By integrating motion tracking into your video trimming functionality, you can enhance user experience and provide more advanced video editing features. In this blog post, we will explore how to add motion tracking during video trimming in Flutter.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need:

- Flutter installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of Flutter and Dart programming language
- An IDE or text editor of your choice

## Step 1: Setting up the Project

First, let's create a new Flutter project by running the following command in your terminal:

```
flutter create motion_tracking_example
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd motion_tracking_example
```

Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.

## Step 2: Installing Dependencies

To add motion tracking functionality to your Flutter project, we'll use the `flutter_ffmpeg` package. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_ffmpeg: ^X.X.X # Replace X.X.X with the latest version of flutter_ffmpeg
```

Save the file and run the following command to install the package:

```
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Implementing Video Trimming

To build the video trimming functionality, we need to import the necessary packages and set up the UI. Let's create a new Flutter widget called `VideoTrimmingScreen`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class VideoTrimmingScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoTrimmingScreenState createState() => _VideoTrimmingScreenState();
}

class _VideoTrimmingScreenState extends State<VideoTrimmingScreen> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // TODO: Implement the video trimming UI
    return Container();
  }
}
```

In the `VideoTrimmingScreen` widget, you can design the video trimming UI using `Container`, `Row`, `Column`, and other Flutter widgets. For simplicity, we will skip the UI implementation in this blog post.

## Step 4: Adding Motion Tracking

To enable motion tracking during video trimming, we need to utilize the `flutter_ffmpeg` package. Modify the `_VideoTrimmingScreenState` class as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_ffmpeg/flutter_ffmpeg.dart';

class _VideoTrimmingScreenState extends State<VideoTrimmingScreen> {
  final FlutterFFmpeg _flutterFFmpeg = FlutterFFmpeg();

  Future<void> addMotionTrackingToTrimmedVideo() async {
    final String inputVideoPath = '/path/to/input/video.mp4'; // Replace with your input video path
    final String trimmedVideoPath = '/path/to/trimmed/video.mp4'; // Replace with your trimmed video path

    final String command =
        '-i $inputVideoPath -vf "mpdecimate,setpts=N/5/TB" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset slow -c:a copy $trimmedVideoPath';

    final int rc = await _flutterFFmpeg.execute(command);
    if (rc != 0) {
      print('Motion tracking failed: ${_flutterFFmpeg.getLastCommandOutput()}');
    } else {
      print('Motion tracking completed successfully!');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // TODO: Implement the video trimming UI
    return Container();
  }
}
```

In the `addMotionTrackingToTrimmedVideo` method, we are using the `FlutterFFmpeg` instance to execute the FFmpeg command that applies motion tracking to the trimmed video. Make sure to replace the `inputVideoPath` and `trimmedVideoPath` with the actual paths of your input and trimmed videos.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we've learned how to add motion tracking during video trimming in Flutter. By integrating motion tracking functionality using the `flutter_ffmpeg` package, you can enhance the video editing experience for your users. Feel free to explore more advanced motion tracking techniques and customize the UI based on your requirements.

Happy coding!
