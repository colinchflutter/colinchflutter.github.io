Trimming videos is a common requirement in many video editing applications. In Flutter, we can easily achieve video trimming functionality using the `video_player` package. However, the default behavior does not allow the user to select a custom thumbnail for the trimmed video. In this article, we will explore how to enhance the trimming feature by adding the ability to select a custom video thumbnail.

## Setting up the Project

First, let's set up a Flutter project and add the `video_player` package as a dependency. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
$ flutter create custom_thumbnail_trim
$ cd custom_thumbnail_trim
$ flutter pub add video_player
$ flutter pub get
```

This will create a new Flutter project called `custom_thumbnail_trim` and add the `video_player` package to it.

## Adding Custom Thumbnail Selection

### 1. Importing the Required Packages

In your `pubspec.yaml` file, add the following dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_player: ^2.2.2
```

After adding the dependencies, run `flutter pub get` to download and link the packages to your project.

Next, in your Dart file, import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';
```

### 2. Adding Video Trimming Functionality

To add video trimming functionality, we will create a class called `VideoTrimmer` which extends `StatefulWidget`. This class will handle all the logic and user interactions related to trimming the video.

```dart
class VideoTrimmer extends StatefulWidget {
  final String videoFilePath;
  
  const VideoTrimmer({required this.videoFilePath});
  
  @override
  _VideoTrimmerState createState() => _VideoTrimmerState();
}
```

### 3. Initializing Video Player and Displaying Thumbnail

In the `_VideoTrimmerState` class, we will initialize the video player and display the video thumbnail by using the `VideoPlayerController`:

```dart
class _VideoTrimmerState extends State<VideoTrimmer> {
  late final VideoPlayerController _controller;
  late final Future<void> _initializeVideoPlayerFuture;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = VideoPlayerController.file(File(widget.videoFilePath));
    _initializeVideoPlayerFuture = _controller.initialize();
  }
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder(
      future: _initializeVideoPlayerFuture,
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
          // Display video thumbnail using _controller.value.thumbnail
          return AspectRatio(
            aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
            child: VideoPlayer(_controller),
          );
        } else {
          // Display loading indicator
          return CircularProgressIndicator();
        }
      },
    );
  }
}
```

### 4. Adding Thumbnail Selection Functionality

To add thumbnail selection functionality, we can use the `flutter_ffmpeg` package. This package allows us to extract video frames at specific time intervals. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_ffmpeg: ^2.2.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to download and link the package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_ffmpeg/flutter_ffmpeg.dart';
```

In the `_VideoTrimmerState` class, add the following method:

```dart
Future<Uint8List?> extractThumbnail(int position) async {
  final FlutterFFmpeg _flutterFFmpeg = FlutterFFmpeg();
  
  final String outputPath = 'path_to_save_thumbnail.jpg';
  
  final int resultCode = await _flutterFFmpeg.execute(
    '-i ${widget.videoFilePath} -ss $position -vframes 1 $outputPath',
  );
  
  if (resultCode == 0) {
    final File thumbnailFile = File(outputPath);
    
    if (thumbnailFile.existsSync()) {
      return await thumbnailFile.readAsBytes();
    }
  }
  
  return null;
}
```

### 5. Displaying Thumbnail Selection UI

Now, let's display the UI for thumbnail selection. We can use a `Slider` widget to allow the user to select the position of the thumbnail. Add the following code inside the `build` method of the `_VideoTrimmerState` class:

```dart
late double _thumbnailPosition = 0.0;

// Calculate the total duration of the video
final int videoDuration = _controller.value.duration.inSeconds;

Slider(
  min: 0.0,
  max: videoDuration.toDouble(),
  value: _thumbnailPosition,
  onChanged: (double value) {
    setState(() {
      _thumbnailPosition = value;
    });
  },
  onChangeEnd: (double value) async {
    final Uint8List? thumbnail = await extractThumbnail(value.toInt());
    // Use the selected thumbnail
  },
),
```

### 6. Using the Selected Thumbnail

Once the user selects a thumbnail, you can use it in your application for further processing or display. Update the `onChangeEnd` callback of the `Slider` with the desired functionality, such as updating a `Image` widget with the selected thumbnail.

```dart
final Uint8List? thumbnail = await extractThumbnail(value.toInt());
  
if (thumbnail != null) {
  setState(() {
    _selectedThumbnail = MemoryImage(thumbnail);
  });
}
```

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this article, you can enhance the video trimming functionality in your Flutter application by allowing users to select custom video thumbnails. This can greatly improve the user experience and make your app stand out from the rest.
