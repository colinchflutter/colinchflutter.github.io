Have you ever needed to trim a video in your Flutter application, but wanted to ensure that important moments were not cut off? One way to solve this problem is by using face detection to identify key moments in the video and automatically trimming around them. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement video trimming with face detection in Flutter.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:

- Flutter installed on your computer
- Basic knowledge of Flutter development

## Installing the Required Packages

To get started, we need to install the necessary packages to work with video and face detection in Flutter. Open your Flutter project and add the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_trimmer: ^2.0.0
  mlkit_face_detection: ^1.2.0
```

Run `flutter packages get` to install the packages.

## Trimming the Video

Once the packages are installed, we can proceed with trimming the video. Create a new Dart file and import the required packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_trimmer/video_trimmer.dart';
import 'package:mlkit_face_detection/mlkit_face_detection.dart';
```

Next, we need to define a `Trimmer` object and load the video file:

```dart
Trimmer _trimmer = Trimmer();

Future<void> _loadVideo() async {
  await _trimmer.loadVideo(videoFile: File('path/to/video'));
}
```

Now, let's implement the face detection using the ML Kit Face Detection package. Initialize the face detector:

```dart
FaceDetection _faceDetection = FaceDetection();

Future<void> _detectFaces() async {
  List<Face> faces = await _faceDetection.detectFaces();
  // Process the detected faces
}
```

Within the `_detectFaces` method, you can process the detected faces as per your requirements. For example, you could find the moments with the most number of faces on-screen and determine the start and end timestamps for trimming.

Finally, let's implement the video trimming based on the identified timestamps:

```dart
Future<void> _trimVideo(int startTimestamp, int endTimestamp) async {
  await _trimmer.trim(
    startTimestamp: startTimestamp,
    endTimestamp: endTimestamp,
    videoFile: File('path/to/video'),
    trimmedVideoFile: File('path/to/trimmed_video'),
  );
}
```

In this code snippet, `startTimestamp` and `endTimestamp` refer to the timestamps identified from the face detection.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement video trimming with face detection in Flutter. By leveraging the ML Kit Face Detection package, we were able to detect faces in a video and automatically trim it based on the identified timestamps. This approach ensures that important moments are preserved while removing unnecessary footage. Feel free to customize the implementation based on your own requirements.
