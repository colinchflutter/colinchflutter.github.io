If you are building a video editing app using Flutter, you might want to consider adding video denoising capabilities to enhance the video quality. Video denoising is a technique used to reduce the noise present in videos, resulting in a clearer and more visually appealing output.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement video denoising during video trimming in a Flutter app. We will be using the [video_processing](https://pub.dev/packages/video_processing) package, which provides a wide range of video processing functionalities.

## Getting Started

Before we begin, make sure you have a Flutter project set up. You can create a new project using the following command:

```shell
flutter create video_denoising_app
```

Next, navigate to your project directory:

```shell
cd video_denoising_app
```

Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `video_processing` package dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_processing: ^0.4.1
```

Save the file and run the following command to fetch the package:

```shell
flutter pub get
```

## Implementing Video Denoising

1. First, import the required libraries:

```dart
import 'package:video_processing/video_processing.dart';
```

2. Load the video file using the `decodeVideo` function:

```dart
final video = await Video.decodeVideo('path/to/video.mp4');
```

3. Trim the video using the `trim` method:

```dart
final trimmedVideo = video.trim(start:Duration(seconds: 5), end: Duration(seconds: 10));
```

4. Apply the video denoising filter using the `denoise` method:

```dart
final denoisedVideo = trimmedVideo.denoise();
```

5. Finally, save the denoised video to a new file:

```dart
await denoisedVideo.exportTo('path/to/denoised_video.mp4');
```

## Conclusion

By adding video denoising capabilities to your video trimming app, you can greatly enhance the quality of the output videos. The `video_processing` package provides a straightforward way to implement video denoising in Flutter apps.

Remember to experiment with different denoising parameters to achieve the desired output. Enjoy developing your video editing app with Flutter!
