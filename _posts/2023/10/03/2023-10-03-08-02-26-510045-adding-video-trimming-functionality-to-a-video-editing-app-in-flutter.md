Flutter is a popular cross-platform framework used to develop mobile applications. It provides a variety of features and libraries that make it easy to build high-performance apps. In this article, we will explore how to add video trimming functionality to a video editing app in Flutter.

## Understanding the requirements

Before we begin implementing the video trimming functionality, let's understand the requirements. Video trimming allows users to select a specific portion of a video and trim it down to a desired length. The trimmed video should then replace the original video in the app.

## Installing required dependencies

To get started, we need to install the necessary dependencies. Open your project's `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_player: ^2.2.5
  flutter_ffmpeg: ^0.4.0
```

The `video_player` package is used to play videos in Flutter, while `flutter_ffmpeg` provides a way to process videos, including trimming.

## Implementing the video trimming functionality

Once the dependencies are installed, let's implement the video trimming functionality in our Flutter app.

1. Import the required packages:

```dart
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';
import 'package:flutter_ffmpeg/flutter_ffmpeg.dart';
```

2. Create a `VideoPlayerController` to load and play the video:

```dart
VideoPlayerController videoController;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();

  videoController = VideoPlayerController.network('https://example.com/video.mp4')
    ..initialize().then((_) {
      // Once the video is initialized, start playing it
      videoController.play();
      setState(() {});
    });
}

@override
void dispose() {
  super.dispose();
  videoController.dispose();
}
```

3. Add a slider widget to select the desired portion of the video:

```dart
double startValue = 0.0;
double endValue = 0.0;

Slider(
  min: 0.0,
  max: videoController.value.duration.inMilliseconds.toDouble(),
  onChanged: (newValue) {
    setState(() {
      startValue = newValue;
      endValue = newValue;
    });
  },
);
```

4. Implement the video trimming functionality using `flutter_ffmpeg`:

```dart
FlutterFFmpeg _flutterFFmpeg = FlutterFFmpeg();

void _trimVideo() async {
  String outputPath = '/path/to/output/video.mp4';

  int startMs = startValue.toInt();
  int endMs = endValue.toInt();

  String trimCommand = '-ss $startMs -t ${endMs - startMs} -i ${videoController.dataSource} -acodec copy -vcodec copy $outputPath';

  await _flutterFFmpeg.execute(trimCommand);

  // Replace the original video with the trimmed one
  setState(() {
    videoController = VideoPlayerController.network(outputPath)
      ..initialize().then((_) {
        videoController.play();
      });
  });
}
```

5. Finally, add a button to trigger the video trimming:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    _trimVideo();
  },
  child: Text('Trim Video'),
);
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to add video trimming functionality to a video editing app in Flutter. We used the `video_player` package to play videos and the `flutter_ffmpeg` library to process and trim videos. By following these steps, you can enhance your Flutter app with video editing capabilities.
