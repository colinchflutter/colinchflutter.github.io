Are you developing a Flutter application that involves video editing functionality? One important feature of a video editing app is the ability to trim videos. While trimming, it can be very helpful to have visual markers on the video timeline to indicate the start and end points of the trimmed section. In this blog post, we will explore how to add video timeline markers during trimming in Flutter.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the implementation, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Flutter SDK installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of Flutter and Dart programming language

## Implementation

To add video timeline markers during trimming in Flutter, we will be using the `video_player` and `flutter_ffmpeg` packages. 

First, let's start by adding these packages to your pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_player: ^2.1.0
  flutter_ffmpeg: ^0.4.0
```

After adding the dependencies, run the `flutter pub get` command to fetch the packages.

Next, create a new Flutter widget called `TrimVideoScreen`. In this widget, we will set up the video player and add the trimming functionality.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';

class TrimVideoScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  final String videoPath;

  const TrimVideoScreen({required this.videoPath});

  @override
  _TrimVideoScreenState createState() => _TrimVideoScreenState();
}

class _TrimVideoScreenState extends State<TrimVideoScreen> {
  late VideoPlayerController _videoController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    _videoController = VideoPlayerController.asset(widget.videoPath)
      ..initialize().then((_) {
        setState(() {
          _videoController.play();
        });
      });
    super.initState();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _videoController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Trim Video"),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          AspectRatio(
            aspectRatio: _videoController.value.aspectRatio,
            child: VideoPlayer(_videoController),
          ),
          // TODO: Add timeline markers here
          // TODO: Implement trimming functionality
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, we have created a `TrimVideoScreen` widget that initializes the `video_player` package and starts playing the video. The `AspectRatio` widget is used to display the video in the correct aspect ratio. 

Now, let's add the video timeline markers. We can achieve this by using the `Stack` widget to overlay marker widgets on top of the video player widget.

```dart
Stack(
  children: [
    AspectRatio(
      aspectRatio: _videoController.value.aspectRatio,
      child: VideoPlayer(_videoController),
    ),
    Positioned(
      left: 50, // Adjust the position according to your UI design
      right: 50, // Adjust the position according to your UI design
      top: 0, // Adjust the position according to your UI design
      height: 5, // Adjust the height of the marker
      child: Container(
        color: Colors.red, // Adjust the marker color
      ),
    ),
    // Add more marker widgets as needed
  ],
),
```

In the above code, we have added a `Container` widget with a red background color to represent the timeline marker. You can customize the position, size, and color of the marker according to your UI design.

Finally, let's implement the trimming functionality. To trim the video, we can use the `flutter_ffmpeg` package to execute FFmpeg commands. Here's an example of how you can trim the video from the selected start and end markers:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_ffmpeg/flutter_ffmpeg.dart';

...

void trimVideo(int startMarker, int endMarker) async {
  final FlutterFFmpeg _flutterFFmpeg = FlutterFFmpeg();
  final String outputPath = "/path/to/trimmed/video.mp4";
  final String command = '-i ${widget.videoPath} -ss $startMarker -to $endMarker -c:v copy -c:a copy $outputPath';
  int result = await _flutterFFmpeg.execute(command);

  if (result == 0) {
    // Video trimming successful
    setState(() {
      _videoController = VideoPlayerController.file(File(outputPath)) // Update video controller with trimmed video
        ..initialize().then((_) {
          setState(() {
            _videoController.play();
          });
        });
    });
  } else {
    // Handle video trimming error
  }
}
```

In the above code, we are using the FlutterFFmpeg package to execute the FFmpeg command to trim the video. The trimmed video will be saved to the `outputPath`. Once the trimming is complete, we update the video player controller with the trimmed video.

That's it! You have successfully implemented video timeline markers during trimming in Flutter. Feel free to customize the marker appearance and explore more features provided by the `video_player` and `flutter_ffmpeg` packages to enhance your video editing app.

Keep coding and happy Fluttering!
