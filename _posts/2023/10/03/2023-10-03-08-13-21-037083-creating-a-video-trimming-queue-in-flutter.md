In today's digital age, videos play an essential role in various applications and platforms. As a developer, you may encounter the need to implement functionalities like video trimming in your Flutter app. In this blog post, we will explore how to create a video trimming queue in Flutter using the **video_player** and **path_provider** plugins.

## Setting up the Dependencies
To get started, we need to add the necessary dependencies to our `pubspec.yaml` file.

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  video_player: ^2.2.0
  path_provider: ^2.0.2
```

Run a `flutter pub get` command to fetch the dependencies.

## Creating the Video Trimming Queue
Let's start by creating a class called `VideoTrimmingQueue` that will handle the video trimming operations.

```dart
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';

class VideoTrimmingQueue {
  List<String> _queuedVideos = [];

  Future<void> trimVideo(String videoPath, int startMs, int endMs) async {
    _queuedVideos.add(videoPath);

    // Trim video with the specified start and end time
      
    // Use the video_player plugin to play the trimmed video
      
    // Save the trimmed video to a new file
      
    // Cleanup the original video file
      
    _queuedVideos.remove(videoPath);
  }
}
```

In the `trimVideo` method, we add the video path to a queue and proceed with the video trimming process. You can use FFmpeg or other video processing libraries to perform the trimming based on the specified start and end time. Once the video is trimmed, you can use the `video_player` plugin to play the trimmed video.

To save the trimmed video to a new file, we can use the `path_provider` plugin to access the device's storage directory. Finally, we clean up the original video file and remove it from the queue.

## Implementing the Video Trimming Queue
Now that we have our `VideoTrimmingQueue` class, let's implement it in our Flutter app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final VideoTrimmingQueue _trimmingQueue = VideoTrimmingQueue();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Video Trimming Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Video Trimming Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              _trimmingQueue.trimVideo('path/to/video.mp4', 2000, 5000);
            },
            child: Text('Trim Video'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Here, we initialize an instance of `VideoTrimmingQueue` in our `MyApp` widget and call the `trimVideo` method with the desired video path, start time in milliseconds, and end time in milliseconds. You can customize the UI and functionality according to your app's needs.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we learned how to create a video trimming queue in Flutter. By implementing the `VideoTrimmingQueue` class, you can easily handle video trimming operations in your Flutter app. Feel free to enhance this implementation according to your specific requirements and explore more features of the `video_player` and `path_provider` plugins.
