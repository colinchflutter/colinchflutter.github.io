Flutter is a popular framework for building cross-platform apps, and it provides a wide range of features and capabilities. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement video trimming with watermarking in Flutter using the `video_trimmer` and `video_editor` packages.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have Flutter installed on your system. You can check for Flutter installation by running `flutter doctor` in the terminal.

## Installing the required packages

To implement video trimming and watermarking functionality, we need to install two Flutter packages: `video_trimmer` and `video_editor`.

Open your Flutter project and add the packages to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  video_trimmer: ^2.0.0
  video_editor: ^0.1.1
```

After adding the packages to your `pubspec.yaml`, run `flutter pub get` in the terminal to install them.

## Trimming a Video

First, let's look at how to trim a video using the `video_trimmer` package. This package provides a `VideoTrimmer` widget that allows users to trim videos with a simple interface.

To use the `VideoTrimmer` widget, add the following code to your Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:video_trimmer/video_trimmer.dart';

class VideoScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoScreenState createState() => _VideoScreenState();
}

class _VideoScreenState extends State<VideoScreen> {
  final Trimmer _trimmer = Trimmer();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    _trimmer.loadVideo(videoFile: File('path_to_your_video'));
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Trimmer'),
      ),
      body: Builder(
        builder: (context) => Center(
          child: RaisedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              final editedVideo = await _trimmer.trim(
                start: Duration(seconds: 2),
                end: Duration(seconds: 10),
              );
              // Do something with the edited video
            },
            child: Text('Trim Video'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, we import the `video_trimmer` package and create an instance of the `Trimmer` class. We then load the video file using the `loadVideo` method in the `initState`. Next, we create a `RaisedButton` that calls the `trim` method when pressed. This method trims the video from the specified start time to the end time and returns the edited video.

## Adding Watermark to a Video

Next, let's see how to add a watermark to a video using the `video_editor` package. This package provides a `VideoEditor` class that allows you to edit videos by adding various effects, including watermarking.

To use the `VideoEditor` class for adding a watermark to a video, add the following code to your Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:video_editor/video_editor.dart';

class VideoScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoScreenState createState() => _VideoScreenState();
}

class _VideoScreenState extends State<VideoScreen> {
  final VideoEditor _videoEditor = VideoEditor();

  Future<void> addWatermark() async {
    try {
      await _videoEditor.openVideo('path_to_your_video');
      await _videoEditor.setWatermark(
        File('path_to_watermark_image'),
        position: WatermarkPosition.bottomRight,
      );
      final editedVideo = await _videoEditor.exportVideo();
      // Do something with the edited video
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle error
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Watermarking'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RaisedButton(
          onPressed: addWatermark,
          child: Text('Add Watermark'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, we import the `video_editor` package and create an instance of the `VideoEditor` class. We then open the video using the `openVideo` method and set the watermark using the `setWatermark` method, specifying the position of the watermark. Finally, we export the edited video using the `exportVideo` method.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement video trimming with watermarking in Flutter using the `video_trimmer` and `video_editor` packages. You can further enhance your app by combining these functionalities and adding more video editing features. Flutter provides a powerful platform for building rich media applications, and with these packages, you can create impressive video editing experiences.
