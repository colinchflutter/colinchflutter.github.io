With the increasing popularity of video editing applications, it has become essential to provide high-quality tools for manipulating videos in Flutter. One key feature is the ability to trim videos, but simply cutting out frames can result in a jerky playback experience. To solve this issue, we can incorporate frame interpolation during the video trimming process.

## What is Frame Interpolation?

Frame interpolation is a technique used to create intermediate frames between two existing frames. It helps smooth out the motion between frames and improves the overall visual experience. By adding interpolated frames during video trimming, we can maintain smooth transitions and avoid jerky playback.

## Implementing Frame Interpolation in Flutter

To implement frame interpolation during video trimming in Flutter, we can utilize the [`image_sequence_animator`](https://pub.dev/packages/image_sequence_animator) package. This package provides a way to animate a series of images at a specific frame rate, which is perfect for our use case.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Install the `image_sequence_animator` package by adding it to the `pubspec.yaml` file in your Flutter project:

   ```
   dependencies:
     image_sequence_animator: ^1.0.0
   ```
   
2. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```
   import 'package:image_sequence_animator/image_sequence_animator.dart';
   ```
   
3. Load your video frames into a list of `Image`s or `ImageProvider`s:

   ```dart
   List<ImageProvider> frames = [
     AssetImage('assets/frame1.png'),
     AssetImage('assets/frame2.png'),
     // Add more frames...
   ];
   ```

4. Create an `ImageSequenceAnimator` widget and pass it the list of frames:

   ```dart
   ImageSequenceAnimator(
     sequence: frames,
     frameDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 100),
     // Specify other properties, such as fit, repeat, etc.
   )
   ```

5. Add the `ImageSequenceAnimator` widget to your Flutter UI:

   ```dart
   class MyVideoPlayer extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Container(
         // Add other video player widgets...
         child: ImageSequenceAnimator(
           sequence: frames,
           frameDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 100),
           // Specify other properties, such as fit, repeat, etc.
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

By utilizing the `image_sequence_animator` package, we can easily incorporate frame interpolation during video trimming in Flutter. This technique enhances the visual quality and provides a smoother playback experience for users.
