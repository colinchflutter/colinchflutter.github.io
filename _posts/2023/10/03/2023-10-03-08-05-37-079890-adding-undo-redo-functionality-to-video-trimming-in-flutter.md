In this tutorial, we will explore how to add undo-redo functionality to video trimming in a Flutter application. Undo-redo functionality allows users to revert or redo their actions, providing a better user experience and increased control while trimming videos.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine
- A Flutter project set up
- A basic understanding of Flutter development and video manipulation

## Getting Started

To start, we need to set up the video trimming functionality in our Flutter application. We can achieve this by utilizing a video editing library like `video_player` or `flutter_ffmpeg` to play and manipulate videos.

1. Install the required video editing libraries, like `video_player` or `flutter_ffmpeg`, by adding them to your `pubspec.yaml` file and running `flutter packages get`.

2. Set up the video player widget to load and play the video you want to trim. You can follow the documentation provided by the chosen library to achieve this.

```dart
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';

...

VideoPlayerController _controller;

...

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _controller = VideoPlayerController.asset('path_to_video_file').initialize();
}

@override
void dispose() {
  super.dispose();
  _controller.dispose();
}

...

VideoPlayer(_controller)
```

## Implementing Undo-Redo Functionality

Now that we have the video trimming functionality set up, let's proceed with implementing the undo-redo functionality.

1. Create a `Stack` widget that contains the video player widget and a trim handle widget.

```dart
Stack(
  children: [
    VideoPlayer(_controller),
    TrimHandleWidget(),
  ],
)
```

2. Inside the `TrimHandleWidget` widget, create two buttons for undo and redo functionality.

```dart
class TrimHandleWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Row(
      children: [
        IconButton(
          icon: Icon(Icons.undo),
          onPressed: _handleUndo,
        ),
        IconButton(
          icon: Icon(Icons.redo),
          onPressed: _handleRedo,
        ),
      ],
    );
  }

  void _handleUndo() {
    // Logic to undo the previous action
  }

  void _handleRedo() {
    // Logic to redo the previously undone action
  }
}
```

## Storing and Managing Actions

To implement undo-redo functionality, we need to store and manage the actions performed on the video trimming.

1. Create a list to store the actions.

```dart
List<TrimAction> _actions = [];
```

2. Define a `TrimAction` class to represent the actions performed on the video.

```dart
class TrimAction {
  final double start;
  final double end;

  TrimAction(this.start, this.end);
}
```

3. Update the `_handleUndo` and `_handleRedo` functions to manage the actions list and perform undo and redo operations.

```dart
void _handleUndo() {
  if (_actions.isNotEmpty) {
    final previousAction = _actions.removeLast();
    _controller.seekTo(Duration(seconds: previousAction.start.toInt()));
    // Add logic to update the trim handle positions accordingly
  }
}

void _handleRedo() {
  // Add logic to redo the previously undone action, if any
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented undo-redo functionality for video trimming in your Flutter application. Users can now easily revert or redo their trimming actions, providing a seamless video editing experience.
