## Setting up Flutter WebGL

To get started, make sure you have Flutter and the Flutter Web SDK installed on your machine. If you haven't already, you can follow the official Flutter documentation for setting up Flutter on your machine.

Once Flutter is set up, you need to enable Flutter for web:

```shell
flutter channel beta
flutter upgrade
flutter config --enable-web
```

Next, create a new Flutter project:

```shell
flutter create my_web_app
```

Change to the project directory:

```shell
cd my_web_app
```

Finally, run the project on the web:

```shell
flutter run -d chrome
```

## Handling keyboard events

To implement keyboard shortcuts, we need to handle the keyboard events. In Flutter, we can accomplish this using the `RawKeyboardListener` widget. This widget allows us to listen for raw keyboard events and handle them accordingly.

Let's create a simple example where pressing the "F" key will toggle fullscreen mode on our WebGL canvas:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return RawKeyboardListener(
      focusNode: FocusNode(),
      onKey: (RawKeyEvent event) {
        if (event.logicalKey == LogicalKeyboardKey.keyF) {
          if (event is RawKeyDownEvent) {
            // Toggle fullscreen
            document.documentElement?.requestFullscreen();
          }
        }
      },
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Flutter WebGL Shortcuts',
        theme: ThemeData(
          primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        ),
        home: MyHomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter WebGL Shortcuts'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Press "F" to toggle fullscreen mode.',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we use the `RawKeyboardListener` to capture keyboard events. We check if the pressed key is "F" and, if it is, we toggle fullscreen mode using the `requestFullscreen()` method.

## Conclusion

Implementing keyboard shortcuts in your Flutter WebGL app can greatly enhance the user experience. By using the `RawKeyboardListener` widget, you can easily handle keyboard events and implement custom functionality based on user input. Whether you want to provide power users with shortcuts or simplify your app's navigation, keyboard shortcuts are a valuable addition to your Flutter Web application.
