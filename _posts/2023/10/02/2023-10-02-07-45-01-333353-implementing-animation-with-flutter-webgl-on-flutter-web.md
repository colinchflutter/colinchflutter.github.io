Flutter is a powerful cross-platform framework that enables developers to build beautiful and responsive applications. With the introduction of Flutter Web, developers can now create web applications using the same codebase as their mobile apps. Flutter Web allows for the use of WebGL, which opens up the possibility of implementing stunning animations in web applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement animation with Flutter WebGL on Flutter Web.

## What is WebGL?

WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within compatible web browsers. It provides high-performance rendering capabilities, leveraging the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) of the user's device to achieve smooth and visually appealing graphics. 

Flutter WebGL uses this technology to bring native-like animations and graphics to web applications built with the Flutter framework.

## Setting up a Flutter Web project with WebGL support

To get started with Flutter Web and WebGL, you first need to set up a Flutter project targeting the web platform. You can do this by running the following command:

```
flutter create my_web_app
```

Next, navigate into the project directory:

```
cd my_web_app
```

Now, open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_web: any
  flutter_web_ui: any
```

Save the `pubspec.yaml` file and run the following command to fetch the dependencies:

```
flutter pub get
```

Once the dependencies have been fetched, you can enable WebGL by modifying the `web/index.html` file. Add the following script tag just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/110/three.min.js"></script>
```

## Implementing Animation with Flutter WebGL

Now that your Flutter Web project is set up with WebGL support, you can start implementing animations. 

For this example, let's create a simple spinning cube animation. 

In your main Flutter widget, import the `flutter_web_gl` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_web_gl/flutter_web_gl.dart';
```

Next, create a new `CustomGLWidget` widget that extends the `WebGLRendererWidget` class:

```dart
class CustomGLWidget extends WebGLRendererWidget {
  @override
  WebGLRenderer createRenderer() {
    return WebGLRenderer(
      clearColor: Color.fromHex('#000000'),
    );
  }
  
  @override
  void onAnimationFrame(WebGLRenderer renderer, double deltaTime) {
    renderer.render(deltaTime / 1000); // Update and render the scene
  }
}
```

In the above code, we override the `createRenderer` method to create a new instance of `WebGLRenderer` and set the clear color to black. We also override the `onAnimationFrame` method to update and render the scene on every frame.

Now, in your `main` function, replace the `runApp` method with the following:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(CustomGLWidget());
}
```

Finally, run your Flutter Web app by executing the following command:

```
flutter run -d chrome
```

You should now see a spinning cube animation on the screen.

## Conclusion

Implementing animation with Flutter WebGL on Flutter Web opens up a world of possibilities for creating visually stunning and interactive web applications. By leveraging the power of WebGL, developers can bring native-like animations and graphics to their Flutter Web projects. With the simple example provided in this blog post, you can now get started on creating your own amazing animations in Flutter Web. Happy coding!
