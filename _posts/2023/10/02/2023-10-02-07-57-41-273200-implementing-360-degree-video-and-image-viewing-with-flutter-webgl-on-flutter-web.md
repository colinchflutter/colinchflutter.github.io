The rise of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) has brought immersive experiences to the forefront of technology. One popular way to experience these immersive environments is through 360-degree videos and images. In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement 360-degree video and image viewing using Flutter WebGL on Flutter Web.

## What is Flutter WebGL?

Flutter WebGL is a set of Flutter bindings for WebGL, which is a web standard that allows rendering 3D graphics and interactive content on web browsers. Flutter WebGL enables developers to leverage the power of WebGL and build rich and interactive 3D applications within the Flutter framework.

## Setting up Flutter WebGL

To get started, you'll need to install Flutter and set up a Flutter project for web development. Follow the official Flutter documentation to set up Flutter for web development: [Flutter Web Setup Guide](https://flutter.dev/web).

Once you have set up your Flutter project, you can add Flutter WebGL as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_webgl: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

## Creating a 360-degree viewer

Now, let's create a simple 360-degree viewer using Flutter WebGL. We will use the `WebGLRenderer` class provided by Flutter WebGL to render the 360-degree content.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_webgl/flutter_webgl.dart';

class Viewer extends StatefulWidget {
  final String url;

  Viewer({required this.url});

  @override
  _ViewerState createState() => _ViewerState();
}

class _ViewerState extends State<Viewer> {
  WebGLRenderer? _renderer;
  double _yaw = 0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _renderer = WebGLRenderer();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _renderer?.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SizedBox(
      width: 800,
      height: 600,
      child: RawKeyboardListener(
        focusNode: FocusNode(),
        onKey: (event) {
          if (event.isKeyPressed(LogicalKeyboardKey.arrowLeft)) {
            setState(() {
              _yaw -= 10;
            });
          } else if (event.isKeyPressed(LogicalKeyboardKey.arrowRight)) {
            setState(() {
              _yaw += 10;
            });
          }
        },
        child: GestureDetector(
          onHorizontalDragUpdate: (details) {
            setState(() {
              _yaw += details.delta.dx;
            });
          },
          child: RepaintBoundary(
            child: CustomPaint(
              size: Size(800, 600),
              willChange: true,
              painter: WebGLPainter(renderer: _renderer!, yaw: _yaw, url: widget.url),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code snippet, we define a `Viewer` widget that takes a `url` parameter representing the URL of the 360-degree video or image to be displayed. Inside the `_ViewerState` class, we initialize a `WebGLRenderer` instance and store it in the `_renderer` variable.

In the `build` method, we create a widget tree that includes a `RawKeyboardListener` and a `GestureDetector`. These allow the user to interact with the 360-degree viewer using both keyboard arrow keys and horizontal gestures.

The `WebGLPainter` class is a custom `CustomPainter` that renders the 360-degree content using the `WebGLRenderer`. It takes the `renderer`, the current `yaw` angle (representing the horizontal rotation), and the `url` of the content.

To display the `Viewer` widget, you can simply add it to your app's widget tree.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to implement 360-degree video and image viewing using Flutter WebGL on Flutter Web. We learned about Flutter WebGL, set up a Flutter project for web development, and created a simple 360-degree viewer. Now you can leverage the power of Flutter and WebGL to create immersive experiences on the web.
