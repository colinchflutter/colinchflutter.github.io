With the release of Flutter 2.5, Flutter Web has become more powerful than ever. One of the exciting features of Flutter Web is the ability to use the WebGL rendering engine to build interactive and 3D experiences. In this tutorial, we will explore how to create custom tooltips and popovers using Flutter WebGL on Flutter Web.

## Understanding Tooltips and Popovers

Tooltips and popovers are UI elements that provide additional information or actions when a user interacts with a specific element on a webpage. Tooltips usually appear when a user hovers over an element, while popovers appear when a user clicks on an element.

## Step 1: Setting up a Flutter Web project

To get started, make sure you have Flutter 2.5 or later installed. Create a new Flutter Web project using the following command:

```
flutter create my_web_app
```

Navigate to the `my_web_app` directory using:

```
cd my_web_app
```

## Step 2: Enabling Flutter WebGL

By default, Flutter Web uses the CanvasKit rendering engine, which provides excellent 2D performance. To enable Flutter WebGL, open the `index.html` file located in the `web` directory and add the following script tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@jemmyfine/canvaskit-wasm/bin/canvaskit.js"></script>
```

This script will load the Flutter WebGL rendering engine.

## Step 3: Creating Custom Tooltips

To create custom tooltips, we will use the `flutter_cupertino_tooltip` package. Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_cupertino_tooltip: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

Next, import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_cupertino_tooltip/flutter_cupertino_tooltip.dart';
```

Now, you can create a custom tooltip by wrapping the target element with the `CupertinoTooltip` widget:

```dart
CupertinoTooltip(
  message: 'This is a tooltip',
  child: Text('Hover over me'),
)
```

## Step 4: Creating Custom Popovers

To create custom popovers, we will use the `flutter_colorpicker` package. Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_colorpicker: ^0.4.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_colorpicker/flutter_colorpicker.dart';
```

To show a popover when an element is clicked, you can use the `showMenu` method from the `flutter_colorpicker` package:

```dart
PopupMenuButton(
  itemBuilder: (BuildContext context) => <PopupMenuEntry>[
    PopupMenuItem(
      child: ElevatedButton(
        child: Text('Change Color'),
        onPressed: () {
          showMenu(
            context: context,
            position: RelativeRect.fromLTRB(0, 0, 0, 0),
            items: [
              PopupMenuItem(
                child: ColorPicker(
                  pickerColor: Color(0xFF000000),
                  onColorChanged: (Color color) {
                    // Handle color change
                  },
                ),
              ),
            ],
          );
        },
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to create custom tooltips and popovers using Flutter WebGL on Flutter Web. With these techniques, you can enhance user interactions and provide a more engaging experience on your Flutter Web applications. Remember to experiment and customize these elements to fit your project's requirements.
