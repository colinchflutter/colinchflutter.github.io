Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google, which allows developers to build beautiful and fast applications for multiple platforms, including the web. With the introduction of Flutter WebGL, developers can now create high-performance web applications with the same codebase as their mobile apps.

In this blog post, we will discuss how to implement file uploading and downloading functionality in a Flutter WebGL application on Flutter Web.

## Uploading Files

To enable file uploading in our Flutter WebGL application, we can use the `FileUploadInputElement` from the `dart:html` package. Here's an example of how to implement file uploading in Flutter WebGL:

```dart
import 'dart:html';

void uploadFile() {
  FileUploadInputElement uploadInput = FileUploadInputElement();
  uploadInput.click();

  uploadInput.onChange.listen((event) {
    final files = uploadInput.files;
    if (files.length == 1) {
      final file = files[0];
      // Handle the uploaded file
      // ...
    }
  });
}
```

In the above code, we create an instance of `FileUploadInputElement` and simulate a click event on it. This opens the file picker dialog, allowing the user to select a file. Once a file is selected, we can access it using the `files` property of the `FileUploadInputElement`.

## Downloading Files

To enable file downloading in our Flutter WebGL application, we can use the `AnchorElement` from the `dart:html` package. Here's an example of how to implement file downloading in Flutter WebGL:

```dart
import 'dart:html';

void downloadFile(String url) {
  AnchorElement anchorElement = AnchorElement(href: url);
  anchorElement.download = 'file.txt';
  anchorElement.click();
}
```

In the above code, we create an instance of `AnchorElement` and set the `href` property to the URL of the file we want to download. We also set the `download` property to specify the file name that the user will see when downloading the file. Finally, we trigger a click event on the anchor element programmatically, which initiates the file download.

## Conclusion

Implementing file uploading and downloading functionality in a Flutter WebGL application on Flutter Web is quite straightforward. By using the `FileUploadInputElement` and `AnchorElement` from the `dart:html` package, we can easily enable these features and enhance our web application's user experience.

Remember to handle the uploaded files on the server-side and validate them before processing.
