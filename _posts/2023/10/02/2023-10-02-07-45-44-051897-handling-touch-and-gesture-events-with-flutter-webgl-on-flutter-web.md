To get started, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine, and create a new Flutter project:

```bash
flutter create flutter_web_gesture
cd flutter_web_gesture
```

Next, open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `flutter_web_gl` package under the `dependencies` section:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_web_gl: any
```

Now, let's modify the default `main.dart` file to include touch and gesture event handling. Replace the existing code with the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_web_gl/flutter_web_gl.dart';
import 'package:flutter_web/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onLongPress: () {
        print('Long press detected!');
      },
      onTap: () {
        print('Tap detected!');
      },
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: Text('Flutter WebGL Touch and Gesture Events'),
          ),
          body: Container(
            alignment: Alignment.center,
            child: Text(
              'Tap or long-press here',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we have used the `GestureDetector` widget, which enables us to handle touch and gesture events. We have defined two event handlers: `onTap` and `onLongPress`. Feel free to customize them according to your needs.

When the app is run, a simple screen with a centered text widget will be displayed. By tapping or long-pressing on the widget, the respective event handlers will be triggered, and the corresponding messages will be printed to the console.

Finally, to view the app on the web, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

Now you can interact with the app directly in your web browser, testing touch and gesture events on Flutter WebGL.

By leveraging the power of Flutter and Flutter WebGL, you can easily handle touch and gesture events on the web in a consistent manner across all platforms. This enables you to build interactive and engaging web applications using Flutter. Happy coding!
