Augmented Reality (AR) has become increasingly popular in recent years, and many developers are exploring ways to create immersive AR experiences. With the release of Flutter Web, it is now possible to build AR applications that run directly in the browser using Flutter and WebGL.

In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage Flutter WebGL to build AR experiences on Flutter Web.

### What is Flutter WebGL?

**Flutter WebGL** is a rendering implementation that enables Flutter applications to run on the web using the native capabilities of the browser. It utilizes WebGL, a JavaScript API for rendering 3D graphics, to render Flutter widgets in a browser environment.

### Setting up Flutter Web and WebGL

To start building AR experiences with Flutter WebGL, ensure you have Flutter SDK installed on your machine. If not, you can follow the Flutter installation guide on the Flutter website.

Once Flutter is set up, you can enable Flutter for web by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
$ flutter config --enable-web
```

Next, create a new Flutter project with the **web** flag:

```shell
$ flutter create my_ar_project --platforms=web
```

Now you can navigate to the project directory:

```shell
$ cd my_ar_project
```

### Adding Flutter WebGL support

To enable Flutter WebGL in your project, open the **pubspec.yaml** file and add the following dependencies under the **dependencies** section:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_web: any
  flutter_web_gl: any
```

Save the file and run the following command to get the dependencies:

```shell
$ flutter packages get
```

### Building an AR experience with Flutter WebGL

To create an AR experience using Flutter WebGL, you can utilize the power of 3D rendering and WebGL APIs to display augmented reality content on the browser. You can use packages like **Three.dart** or **StageXL** to work with WebGL.

Here's an example of how to integrate Three.dart with Flutter WebGL to create a basic AR scene:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_web/material.dart';
import 'package:three/three.dart' as THREE;

class ArScene extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final renderer = THREE.WebGLRenderer();
    final scene = THREE.Scene();
    final camera = THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
      fov: 75,
      aspect: MediaQuery.of(context).size.aspectRatio,
      near: 0.1,
      far: 1000,
    );
  
    final geometry = THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
    final material = THREE.MeshBasicMaterial(color: THREE.Color(0x00ff00));
    final cube = THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
    scene.add(cube);
  
    camera.position.z = 5;

    void animate(_) {
      window.requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    
      cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
      cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
    
      renderer.render(scene, camera);
    }
  
    animate(0);

    return Scaffold(
      body: Container(
        width: double.infinity,
        height: double.infinity,
        child: THREE.WebGLRendererWidget(renderer),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Conclusion
By leveraging the power of Flutter WebGL, you can create immersive AR experiences that run directly in the browser. Flutter's rich set of widgets and the capabilities of WebGL enable developers to build engaging AR applications with ease.

With Flutter Web and WebGL, the possibilities for creating AR experiences are endless. Whether it's virtual try-on, educational applications, or interactive games, AR on Flutter Web opens up new opportunities for developers to explore.

Start building your AR experiences with Flutter WebGL today, and join the exciting world of augmented reality!
