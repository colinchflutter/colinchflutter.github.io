Flutter has opened up a whole new world of possibilities by bringing the power of mobile app development to the web with Flutter Web. When building web applications with Flutter, you may often need to fetch dynamic data from an API to populate your UI. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement dynamic data fetching with Flutter WebGL on Flutter Web.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Flutter Web](https://flutter.dev/web)

## Setting up the project
1. Create a new Flutter project:
   ```sh
   flutter create flutter_webgl_dynamic_data_fetching
   cd flutter_webgl_dynamic_data_fetching
   ```

2. Enable Flutter Web by running the following commands:
   ```sh
   flutter config --enable-web
   flutter create .
   ```

3. Update the dependencies in the `pubspec.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     http: ^0.13.3
   ```

4. Get the dependencies:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Fetching data from an API
To fetch data from an API, we will use the `http` package. Open the `lib/main.dart` file and replace the code with the following:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  List<dynamic> data = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchData();
  }

  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/data'));
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      setState(() {
        data = json.decode(response.body);
      });
    } else {
      // Handle error here
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter WebGL Dynamic Data Fetching',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Dynamic Data Fetching'),
        ),
        body: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: data.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) => ListTile(
            title: Text(data[index]['title']),
            subtitle: Text(data[index]['description']),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, we create a `ListView.builder` to dynamically display the fetched data in a list. When the app starts, `fetchData()` is called, which makes an HTTP GET request to the API and updates the state with the fetched data. The `ListView.builder` then uses this data to populate the UI.

Note: Replace `'https://api.example.com/data'` with the URL of the API you want to fetch data from.

## Building and running the app
To build and run your app on Flutter Web, use the following commands:

```sh
flutter build web
flutter run -d chrome
```

These commands will generate the necessary web assets and launch the app in a Chrome browser.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to implement dynamic data fetching with Flutter WebGL on Flutter Web. We explored how to use the `http` package to make API requests and update the UI with the fetched data. With this knowledge, you can now create web applications that fetch and display dynamic data in real-time. Happy coding!
