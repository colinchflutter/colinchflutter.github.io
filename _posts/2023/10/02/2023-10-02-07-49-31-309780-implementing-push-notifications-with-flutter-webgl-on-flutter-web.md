Push notifications are an essential feature for engaging users and keeping them informed about important updates, even when they are not actively using your application. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement push notifications in a Flutter Web application using Flutter WebGL.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine
- A Flutter WebGL project set up and running

## Step 1: Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

To enable push notifications in your Flutter Web application, you need to set up Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for web. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Create a new project in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. In your project dashboard, click on the "Web" icon to add your web app.
3. Give your app a name and click "Register app".
4. Copy the Firebase configuration details from the provided snippet.

## Step 2: Add Firebase and FCM Dependencies

Open your Flutter project in your preferred code editor and navigate to the `web/index.html` file. Add the following script tag inside the `<body>` tag, just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.2.3/firebase-app.js"></script>
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.2.3/firebase-messaging.js"></script>
```

## Step 3: Initialize Firebase and FCM

Next, navigate to your `web/main.dart` file and import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'package:firebase_messaging/firebase_messaging.dart';
```

Inside your `main()` function, initialize Firebase by adding the following code before calling `runApp()`:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Step 4: Register for Push Notifications

To receive push notifications, you need to register your web app with the Firebase Cloud Messaging service. Add the following code inside your `MyApp` widget's `initState()` method:

```dart
FirebaseMessaging messaging = FirebaseMessaging.instance;
messaging.requestPermission();
```

This code requests permission from the user to receive push notifications in their browser.

## Step 5: Handling Incoming Notifications

To handle incoming notifications, add the following code inside your `MyApp` widget's `initState()` method:

```dart
FirebaseMessaging.onMessage.listen((RemoteMessage message) {
  // Handle the received notification message here
});

FirebaseMessaging.onMessageOpenedApp.listen((RemoteMessage message) {
  // Handle the notification message when app is opened from background
});
```

In the `onMessage` listener, you can implement your desired logic to display the notification to the user. In the `onMessageOpenedApp` listener, you can handle what happens when the user opens the app from the background by interacting with the notification.

## Step 6: Send Test Notifications

To test the push notifications, use the Firebase console or an HTTP request to send a test notification to your application. Make sure you set the `to` field of the notification to the FCM token of your web app.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to implement push notifications with Flutter WebGL on Flutter Web using Firebase Cloud Messaging. Push notifications are a powerful way to engage users and keep them informed about important updates. Remember to handle the received notifications and handle background notifications according to your application's requirements.
