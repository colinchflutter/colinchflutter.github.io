Flutter WebGL is a powerful tool that allows developers to build interactive and visually stunning web applications using Google's Flutter framework. In this tutorial, we will explore how to integrate social media sharing features into a Flutter WebGL application on Flutter Web.

## Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (version 2.0.0 or above)
- Basic knowledge of Flutter and Dart
- Flutter WebGL package

## Step 1: Setting up the Project
1. Create a new Flutter project by running the following command:
   ```shell
   $ flutter create flutter_webgl_social_media
   ```
   
2. Add the Flutter WebGL package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter_webgl: ^0.1.0
   ```

3. Import the necessary packages in your `main.dart` file:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_webgl/flutter_webgl.dart';
   import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';
   ```

## Step 2: Implementing Social Media Sharing
1. To enable sharing functionality, first, create a share button in your Flutter WebGL application's UI. For example:
   ```dart
   GestureDetector(
     onTap: () {
       _shareToSocialMedia();
     },
     child: Icon(Icons.share),
   )
   ```

2. Create a function `_shareToSocialMedia` to handle sharing logic:
   ```dart
   void _shareToSocialMedia() async {
     final url = 'https://your-website.com';
     if (await canLaunch(url)) {
       await launch(url);
     } else {
       throw 'Could not launch $url';
     }
   }
   ```

3. Replace `https://your-website.com` with the URL of your website or the specific page you want to share.

4. Run your Flutter WebGL application on Flutter Web, and when the user taps on the share button, it should open the default browser's share dialog with the specified URL.

## Step 3: Testing and Deployment
1. Test your Flutter WebGL application locally by running the following command:
   ```shell
   $ flutter run -d chrome
   ```

2. Once you are satisfied with the functionality, you can deploy your Flutter WebGL application using the following command:
   ```shell
   $ flutter build web
   ```

3. After the build completes, you can deploy the contents of the `build/web` directory to a web server or hosting platform of your choice.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can easily integrate social media sharing features into your Flutter WebGL application on Flutter Web. This will allow your users to easily share your content with their social networks and increase the overall reach and engagement of your application.
