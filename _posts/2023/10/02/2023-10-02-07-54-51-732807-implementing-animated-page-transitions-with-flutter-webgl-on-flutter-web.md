With the release of Flutter 2.5, Flutter Web has gained support for using WebGL, enabling developers to create rich and interactive web applications. One exciting feature of WebGL is the ability to implement animated page transitions, enhancing the user experience and adding a dynamic touch to web apps.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement animated page transitions using Flutter WebGL on Flutter Web. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following:

- Flutter SDK 2.5 or above installed
- A basic understanding of Flutter web development

## Setting up the Project

1. Create a new Flutter project by running the following command:

   ```bash
   flutter create animated_transitions_webgl
   ```

2. Switch to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd animated_transitions_webgl
   ```

3. Open the project in your favorite code editor.

## Installing Dependencies

To use WebGL in Flutter Web, we need to add the `flutter_widget_from_html` package as a dependency. This package provides a WebView that supports WebGL rendering.

1. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_widget_from_html: ^0.6.0
   ```

2. Save the file and run the following command to fetch the new dependency:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Implementing Animated Page Transitions

Now, let's create a simple Flutter web app with two pages. We will use WebGL to animate the transition between these two pages.

1. In the `lib` directory, create a new file called `home_page.dart`. This will be our initial page.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

   class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(
           title: Text('Home'),
         ),
         body: Center(
           child: Text(
             'Welcome to the Home page!',
             style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

2. Create another file called `second_page.dart` in the same directory. This will be our second page.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

   class SecondPage extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(
           title: Text('Second Page'),
         ),
         body: Center(
           child: Text(
             'This is the second page.',
             style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. In the `lib` directory, open the `main.dart` file and replace its contents with the following code:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:flutter_widget_from_html/flutter_widget_from_html.dart';

   import 'home_page.dart';
   import 'second_page.dart';

   void main() {
     runApp(MyApp());
   }

   class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return MaterialApp(
         title: 'Animated Transitions',
         theme: ThemeData(
           primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
         ),
         initialRoute: '/',
         routes: {
           '/': (context) => HomePage(),
           '/second': (context) => SecondPage(),
         },
       );
     }
   }
   ```

4. Save the file and run the app using the following command:

   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

Now, when you run the app, you should see the home page with the title "Home" displayed in the app bar.

## Implementing the Web App with WebGL

To implement animated page transitions using WebGL, we need to modify the Flutter webview used in our app.

1. Open the `home_page.dart` file and replace its contents with the following code:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:flutter_widget_from_html/flutter_widget_from_html.dart';

   class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
   }

   class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
     bool isLoading = false;

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(
           title: Text('Home'),
         ),
         body: _buildWebView(),
         floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
           onPressed: () {
             setState(() {
               isLoading = true;
             });
             Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
               Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/second');
             });
           },
           child: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
         ),
       );
     }

     Widget _buildWebView() {
       if (isLoading) {
         return Center(
           child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
         );
       } else {
         return HtmlWidget(
           '''
           <html>
           <head>
             <style>
               /* Add custom styles here */
             </style>
           </head>
           <body>
             <h1>Welcome to the Home page!</h1>
           </body>
           </html>
           ''',
         );
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Save the file and run the app again. This time, when you click on the floating action button, you should see a loading indicator. After a delay of 2 seconds, the app will navigate to the second page.

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented animated page transitions using Flutter WebGL on Flutter Web. Feel free to explore and customize the WebGL animation to suit your app's requirements.
