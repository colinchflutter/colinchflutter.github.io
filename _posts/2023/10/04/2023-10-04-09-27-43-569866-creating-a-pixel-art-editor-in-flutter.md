## Introduction

Pixel art is a form of digital art where images are created using small square-shaped pixels. It has gained popularity in recent years and has become a popular art style for games and animations. In this tutorial, we will build a simple pixel art editor that allows users to create their own pixel artwork.

## Setting up the Project

To get started, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can follow the official Flutter installation guide for your specific operating system. Once Flutter is installed, create a new Flutter project using the following command:

```flutter create pixel_art_editor```

## Designing the User Interface

In order to create a pixel art editor, we will need a canvas where users can draw and an interface with color options. For simplicity, we will use a 16x16 grid of boxes as our canvas. We will also provide a set of predefined colors to choose from.

## Implementing the Pixel Art Editor

We will start by creating a Grid widget that represents our canvas. This widget will have a 2D list to store the color values of each pixel. We will then create a GestureDetector to handle user touch events and update the color value of the pixel. Finally, we will create a ColorPicker widget that allows users to select a color from a set of predefined colors.

## Saving and Sharing the Artwork

Once the user has finished creating their pixel artwork, we can provide options to save and share the image. Flutter provides a set of plugins that make it easy to save images to the device's storage and share them via different platforms.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a simple pixel art editor using Flutter. We explored the basics of creating a canvas using a grid of boxes, handling user input, and providing color options for drawing. With further enhancements, such as undo/redo functionality and custom color selection, you can create a more advanced pixel art editor. Now it's your turn to experiment and create amazing pixel art! #flutter #pixel-art
