## Introduction

Flutter is a popular cross-platform framework for building beautiful user interfaces. In this article, we will explore how to create a coloring by numbers app using Flutter. Coloring by numbers is a fun and relaxing activity that involves filling in different areas of an image with colors based on a numbered color palette.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Flutter and Dart programming language. You'll need to have Flutter SDK installed on your system.

## Steps to Implement

### Step 1: Set up a new Flutter project

First, let's create a new Flutter project. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
flutter create coloring_by_numbers_app
```

This will create a new Flutter project with the name "coloring_by_numbers_app". Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd coloring_by_numbers_app
```

### Step 2: Add dependencies

In order to implement the coloring by numbers functionality, we'll need to add a few dependencies to our `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
  image_picker: ^0.8.4
  paint_by_numbers: ^1.0.0
```

Save the file and run the following command to fetch the dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Create the home screen

In the `lib` folder, create a new file called `home_screen.dart`. This will serve as our home screen for the coloring by numbers app. Open the file and add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Coloring By Numbers'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Welcome to Coloring By Numbers App!'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Implement the drawing screen

Next, let's create a new file called `drawing_screen.dart` in the `lib` folder. This screen will display the image that the user wants to color by numbers. Open the file and add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class DrawingScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final String imagePath;

  DrawingScreen({required this.imagePath});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Drawing Screen'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Image.asset(imagePath),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Implement the color palette screen

Next, let's create a new file called `color_palette_screen.dart` in the `lib` folder. This screen will display the color palette for the user to select colors from. Open the file and add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class ColorPaletteScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Color Palette'),
      ),
      body: GridView.count(
        crossAxisCount: 4,
        children: [
          Container(
            color: Colors.red,
          ),
          Container(
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
          Container(
            color: Colors.green,
          ),
          Container(
            color: Colors.yellow,
          ),
          // Add more colors
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Implement navigation

To navigate between screens, we need to add buttons in the `HomeScreen` to go to the `DrawingScreen` and `ColorPaletteScreen`. Open `home_screen.dart` and replace the `Center` widget with the following code:

```dart
Column(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
  children: [
    ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {
        Navigator.push(
          context,
          MaterialPageRoute(
            builder: (context) => DrawingScreen(imagePath: 'assets/images/image.png'),
          ),
        );
      },
      child: Text('Start Coloring'),
    ),
    SizedBox(height: 16),
    ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {
        Navigator.push(
          context,
          MaterialPageRoute(
            builder: (context) => ColorPaletteScreen(),
          ),
        );
      },
      child: Text('Select Colors'),
    ),
  ],
),
```

### Step 7: Run the app

Finally, let's run our app and see the screens in action. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
flutter run
```

You should see the app running on your connected device or emulator. Tapping on the "Start Coloring" button will take you to the `DrawingScreen`, and the "Select Colors" button will navigate you to the `ColorPaletteScreen`.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to implement a coloring by numbers app in Flutter. We created the home screen, drawing screen, and color palette screen. We also added navigation between screens using Flutter's `Navigator` class. Now you can explore further and add functionality to the app, such as filling colors based on the selected number and saving the completed images.

Happy coloring! ðŸŽ¨
