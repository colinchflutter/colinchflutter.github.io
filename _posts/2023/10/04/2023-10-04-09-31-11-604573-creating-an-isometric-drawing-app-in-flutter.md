In this blog post, we will explore how to create an isometric drawing app using the Flutter framework. Isometric drawing is a technique that allows us to draw three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional surface.

## Introduction

Isometric drawing involves representing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional plane by using parallel lines that are not parallel to any of the three coordinate axes. In this app, we will provide users with a canvas where they can draw isometric shapes and objects.

## Setting Up the Project

To get started, make sure you have Flutter installed on your system. Then, create a new Flutter project using the following command:

```
$ flutter create isometric_drawing_app
```

Now, navigate into the project directory:

```
$ cd isometric_drawing_app
```

Open the project in your preferred code editor and delete the existing `lib/main.dart` file. We will start from scratch.

## Designing the User Interface

To create a canvas for drawing, we will use the `CustomPaint` widget provided by Flutter. This widget allows us to create custom drawings by implementing a `paint` method.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class IsometricDrawingCanvas extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Implement your drawing logic here
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(IsometricDrawingCanvas oldDelegate) => false;
}
```

We can now use this custom painter in our app's main widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class IsometricDrawingApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Isometric Drawing App"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CustomPaint(
          painter: IsometricDrawingCanvas(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Implementing the Drawing Functionality

To enable drawing on the canvas, we need to handle user input events such as touching or dragging. Flutter provides the `GestureDetector` widget for this purpose.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class IsometricDrawingApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _IsometricDrawingAppState createState() => _IsometricDrawingAppState();
}

class _IsometricDrawingAppState extends State<IsometricDrawingApp> {
  List<Offset> points = [];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Isometric Drawing App"),
      ),
      body: GestureDetector(
        onPanUpdate: (DragUpdateDetails details) {
          setState(() {
            points.add(details.globalPosition);
          });
        },
        child: CustomPaint(
          painter: IsometricDrawingCanvas(points),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the `IsometricDrawingCanvas` class, we can now use the provided points list to draw lines on the canvas.

## Final Thoughts

In this tutorial, we explored how to create an isometric drawing app using Flutter. We learned how to set up the project, design the user interface, and implement the drawing functionality.

As you continue building your app, you can extend the drawing capabilities by adding tools such as different shapes, colors, and undo/redo functionality. Have fun creating your own isometric masterpieces!
