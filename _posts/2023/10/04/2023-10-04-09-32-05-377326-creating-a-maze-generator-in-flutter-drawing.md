In this blog post, we will learn how to create a maze generator using Flutter's drawing capabilities. We will utilize the `CustomPaint` widget and the `Canvas` class to draw the maze dynamically.

## Introduction

Generating mazes is a fun and challenging problem that can be solved using algorithms like Depth First Search (DFS) or Prim's Algorithm. In this project, we will use Prim's Algorithm to create a random maze.

## Setting up the Project

To get started, create a new Flutter project and import the necessary packages. We will need the `flutter` and `painterly` packages for this project.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:painterly/painterly.dart';
```

## Creating the Maze Generator

Next, we will define a `MazeGenerator` class that will be responsible for generating the maze using Prim's Algorithm. This class will have methods to initialize the maze grid, perform the algorithm, and return the final maze.

```dart
class MazeGenerator {
  int width;
  int height;
  List<List<bool>> maze;

  MazeGenerator({required this.width, required this.height}) {
    initializeMaze();
    generateMaze();
  }

  void initializeMaze() {
    // Initialize the maze grid with dimensions
    maze = List.generate(height, (_) => List.filled(width, false));
  }

  void generateMaze() {
    // Implement Prim's Algorithm to generate the maze
    // ...
  }

  List<List<bool>> getMaze() {
    // Return the final maze grid
    return maze;
  }
}
```

## Drawing the Maze

Now that we have the maze generated, let's create a custom widget called `MazePainter` that will handle the drawing of the maze grid. We will override the `paint` method of the `CustomPainter` class to draw the maze using lines.

```dart
class MazePainter extends CustomPainter {
  List<List<bool>> maze;

  MazePainter(this.maze);

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    double cellSize = size.width / maze.length;

    // Draw the walls of the maze
    Paint wallPaint = Paint()..color = Colors.black;
    for (int i = 0; i < maze.length; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < maze[i].length; j++) {
        if (maze[i][j]) {
          canvas.drawLine(
            Offset(j * cellSize, i * cellSize),
            Offset((j + 1) * cellSize, i * cellSize),
            wallPaint,
          );
          canvas.drawLine(
            Offset(j * cellSize, i * cellSize),
            Offset(j * cellSize, (i + 1) * cellSize),
            wallPaint,
          );
        }
      }
    }
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(MazePainter oldDelegate) => true;
}
```

Finally, we can use the `CustomPaint` widget to display the maze on the screen. We will create a `MazeScreen` widget that initializes the `MazeGenerator`, retrieves the maze grid, and passes it to the `MazePainter`.

```dart
class MazeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    MazeGenerator mazeGenerator = MazeGenerator(width: 10, height: 10);
    List<List<bool>> maze = mazeGenerator.getMaze();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Maze Generator'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CustomPaint(
          painter: MazePainter(maze),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a maze generator in Flutter using the drawing capabilities of the framework. By leveraging `CustomPaint` and the `Canvas` class, we were able to dynamically draw a maze on the screen. Try experimenting with different maze generation algorithms and adding interactive elements to enhance the user experience.
