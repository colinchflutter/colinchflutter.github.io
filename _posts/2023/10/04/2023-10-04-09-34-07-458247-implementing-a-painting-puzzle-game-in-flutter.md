Flutter is a powerful framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of creating a painting puzzle game using Flutter.

## Setting up the Project

To get started, make sure you have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine. Open your preferred code editor and create a new Flutter project by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
flutter create painting_puzzle_game
```

## Creating the Game Board

The first step in creating our painting puzzle game is to set up the game board. We will use a `GridView` widget to display a grid of squares that represent the puzzle pieces. Start by creating a new file called `game_board.dart` and add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class GameBoard extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GridView.count(
      crossAxisCount: 4,
      children: List.generate(16, (index) {
        return Container(
          color: Colors.grey,
          margin: EdgeInsets.all(4),
        );
      }),
    );
  }
}
```

## Implementing Game Logic

Next, let's implement the game logic. We need to shuffle the puzzle pieces and keep track of their positions. Add the following code to the `game_board.dart` file:

```dart
import 'dart:math';

class GameBoard extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _GameBoardState createState() => _GameBoardState();
}

class _GameBoardState extends State<GameBoard> {
  List<int> puzzlePieces;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    puzzlePieces = List.generate(16, (index) => index);
    shufflePieces();
  }

  void shufflePieces() {
    setState(() {
      final random = Random();
      puzzlePieces.shuffle(random);
    });
  }

  //...
}
```

## Adding Interactivity

Now, let's make the puzzle pieces draggable and add interactivity to the game. Update the `_GameBoardState` class as follows:

```dart
class _GameBoardState extends State<GameBoard> {
  //...

  List<bool> isPiecePlaced = List.generate(16, (index) => false);

  void placePiece(int index) {
    setState(() {
      isPiecePlaced[index] = true;
    });
  }

  void resetGame() {
    setState(() {
      isPiecePlaced = List.generate(16, (index) => false);
      shufflePieces();
    });
  }

  //...

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    //...

    return GridView.count(
      crossAxisCount: 4,
      children: List.generate(16, (index) {
        return Draggable<int>(
          childWhenDragging: Container(),
          feedback: Container(
            color: Colors.grey,
            margin: EdgeInsets.all(4),
          ),
          child: Container(
            color: isPiecePlaced[index] ? Colors.blue : Colors.grey,
            margin: EdgeInsets.all(4),
          ),
          data: puzzlePieces[index],
        );
      }),
    );
  }
}
```

## Adding Paint Tools

To make our puzzle game more interesting, let's add paint tools that allow the user to color the puzzle pieces. For this, we can use the `flutter_colorpicker` package. Add the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_colorpicker: any  # add this line
```

Then, update your `game_board.dart` file as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_colorpicker/flutter_colorpicker.dart';

class _GameBoardState extends State<GameBoard> {
  //...

  Color currentColor = Colors.red;

  void changeColor(Color color) {
    setState(() {
      currentColor = color;
    });
  }

  void launchColorPicker() {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return AlertDialog(
          title: const Text('Pick a color'),
          content: SingleChildScrollView(
            child: ColorPicker(
              pickerColor: Colors.red,
              onColorChanged: changeColor,
              enableLabel: true,
            ),
          ),
          actions: <Widget>[
            FlatButton(
              child: const Text('OK'),
              onPressed: () {
                Navigator.of(context).pop();
              },
            ),
          ],
        );
      },
    );
  }

  //...

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    //...

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Painting Puzzle Game'),
        actions: [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.color_lens),
            onPressed: launchColorPicker,
          ),
        ],
      ),
      body: GridView.count(
        //...
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        child: Icon(Icons.refresh),
        onPressed: resetGame,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Conclusion
