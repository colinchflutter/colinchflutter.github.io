QR codes (Quick Response codes) are widely used for various applications such as sharing URLs, contact details, or payment information. In this tutorial, we will see how to generate and draw QR codes in a Flutter application.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following:

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine
- A Flutter project set up and running

## Generating QR Codes

To generate QR codes in Flutter, we will use the `qr_flutter` package. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  qr_flutter: ^3.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

## Drawing a QR Code

First, import the required package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:qr_flutter/qr_flutter.dart';
```

In the `build` method of your widget, create a `QrImage` widget and provide the data for which you want to generate the QR code. For example, we can generate a QR code for a URL:

```dart
QrImage(
  data: 'https://example.com',
  version: QrVersions.auto,
  size: 200.0,
),
```

In the above example, we provide the URL `https://example.com` as the data for the QR code. `version` indicates the size and error correction level of the QR code. Passing `QrVersions.auto` will automatically select the appropriate version. `size` determines the width and height of the QR code in pixels.

## Customizing QR Codes

The `QrImage` widget provides various properties to customize the appearance of the QR code. For example, you can change the color of the QR code by specifying the `color` property:

```dart
QrImage(
  data: 'https://example.com',
  version: QrVersions.auto,
  size: 200.0,
  color: Colors.red,
),
```

This will render the QR code in red color.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to generate and draw QR codes in Flutter using the `qr_flutter` package. We explored customizing the appearance of the QR code by changing the color. You can now integrate QR codes into your Flutter applications for various use cases.

Remember, QR codes can be used for a wide range of applications such as sharing links, contact details, or payment information. Explore the `qr_flutter` package documentation for more advanced usage and customization options.
