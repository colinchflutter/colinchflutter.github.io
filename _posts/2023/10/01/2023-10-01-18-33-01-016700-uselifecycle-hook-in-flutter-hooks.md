Flutter Hooks is a powerful package that allows developers to efficiently manage the state of their Flutter applications using hooks. One of the essential hooks provided by Flutter Hooks is `useLifeCycle`, which allows us to execute code at different stages of the widget's lifecycle, similar to the traditional lifecycle methods in StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget.

To use the `useLifeCycle` hook, follow the steps below:

## Step 1: Import the necessary packages

```dart
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';
```

## Step 2: Define your functional widget using hooks

```dart
class MyWidget extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      // widget code...
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Use the `useLifeCycle` hook in the widget's build method

```dart
class MyWidget extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final lifecycleStatus = useLifeCycle();

    useEffect(() {
      // Called when widget is first inserted into the widget tree
      lifecycleStatus.stage == HookLifeCycle.build ? _onWidgetCreation() : null;
      // Called when widget is removed from the widget tree
      lifecycleStatus.stage == HookLifeCycle.dispose ? _onWidgetDispose() : null;
      // Called on every rebuild of the widget
      lifecycleStatus.stage == HookLifeCycle.reassemble ? _onWidgetRebuild() : null;
      // Additional lifecycle stages can be checked as needed
    }, []);

    // widget code...
  }
}
```

In the example above, we first create a reference to the `useLifeCycle` hook by calling `final lifecycleStatus = useLifeCycle()`. Then, we use the `useEffect` hook to execute certain actions based on the current widget lifecycle stage. In the example, `_onWidgetCreation`, `_onWidgetDispose`, and `_onWidgetRebuild` are placeholder functions that should be replaced with the actual code you want to execute at each specific stage.

By utilizing the `useLifeCycle` hook, we can easily manage the lifecycle of our functional widgets in Flutter Hooks. This allows for cleaner and more organized code, making it easier to develop and maintain Flutter applications.
