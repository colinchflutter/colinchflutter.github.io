## Introduction
In mobile app development, it's often necessary to schedule recurring tasks in the background to perform actions such as fetching data, sending notifications, or updating local databases. In Flutter, WorkManager is a powerful library that allows you to schedule and manage background tasks on both Android and iOS devices. In this blog post, we will explore how to schedule recurring tasks using WorkManager in Flutter.

## Getting started with WorkManager
To use WorkManager in your Flutter project, you need to add the `workmanager` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  workmanager: ^0.4.1
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package. Now you are ready to start using WorkManager in your Flutter project.

## Scheduling a recurring task
To schedule a recurring task with WorkManager, you need to define a callback function that will be executed when the task is triggered. Following is an example of a simple recurring task that prints a message every minute:

```dart
import 'package:workmanager/workmanager.dart';

void callbackDispatcher() {
  print('Recurring task executed');
}

void main() {
  Workmanager.initialize(callbackDispatcher);
  Workmanager.registerPeriodicTask("1", "recurringTask",
      frequency: Duration(minutes: 1));
}
```

In the example above, we define the `callbackDispatcher` function, which prints a message to the console. Next, we call `Workmanager.initialize` to initialize WorkManager with our callback function. Finally, we use `Workmanager.registerPeriodicTask` to schedule a recurring task that will execute the `recurringTask` function every minute.

## Handling task execution
When a scheduled task is triggered, the `callbackDispatcher` function will be called. It's important to note that the callback function runs in the background, so you won't be able to update the UI directly from it. However, you can use other methods like `FlutterLocalNotifications` to send a local notification or call a method that updates the UI indirectly. Remember, the `callbackDispatcher` function should be lightweight to avoid any delays in the execution of your recurring tasks.

## Conclusion
WorkManager is a powerful library for scheduling and managing recurring tasks in Flutter. It provides a simple and efficient way to execute background tasks on both Android and iOS devices. In this blog post, we explored how to schedule a recurring task using WorkManager in Flutter and handle the execution of background tasks. By leveraging WorkManager, you can keep your app up-to-date with the latest data and send timely notifications to your users. Happy coding!
