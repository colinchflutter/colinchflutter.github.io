In this blog post, we'll explore the `useSnackBarState` hook provided by the Flutter Hooks library. This hook allows us to easily manage and display snackbars in our Flutter applications.

## What is Flutter Hooks?

Flutter Hooks is a Flutter package that provides a set of hooks (similar to React Hooks) to easily manage state and simplify logic in Flutter applications. The package offers various hooks that can be used to enhance productivity and code reusability.

## `useSnackBarState` Hook

The `useSnackBarState` hook allows us to manage the state and display of snackbars in our Flutter application. It provides a simple API to show and hide snackbars with ease.

To start using the `useSnackBarState` hook, make sure to add the `flutter_hooks` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_hooks: ^0.18.0
```

Once the package is added, you can import the required libraries in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

Now, let's define our Flutter stateful widget and utilize the `useSnackBarState` hook within it:

```dart
class MySnackBarWidget extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final snackBarState = useSnackBarState();

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Snackbar Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            snackBarState.showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(
                content: Text('Hello from Snackbar!'),
              ),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Show Snackbar'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, we define the `MySnackBarWidget` as a `HookWidget`. Inside the build method, we create an instance of `SnackBarState` using the `useSnackBarState()` hook.

Within the `onPressed` callback of the `ElevatedButton`, we call the `showSnackBar` method on `snackBarState` to display the snackbar.

That's it! You can now run your Flutter application and see the Snackbar in action whenever the button is pressed.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored the `useSnackBarState` hook from the Flutter Hooks library. We learned how to use this hook to easily manage and display snackbars in our Flutter applications. The Flutter Hooks package provides a wide range of hooks that can significantly simplify state management and streamline the development process. Happy coding!
