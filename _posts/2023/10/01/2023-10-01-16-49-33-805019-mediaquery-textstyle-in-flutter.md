In Flutter, the `MediaQuery` class provides a way to retrieve information about the current screen size and other device-specific metrics. It allows us to create responsive UIs by adapting the layout and styles based on the available space.

One useful feature of `MediaQuery` is the ability to define a default `TextStyle` that automatically adjusts based on the screen size. This makes it easy to create text styles that are legible across different devices and orientations.

To use `MediaQuery` to define a responsive `TextStyle`, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

2. Use the `MediaQueryTextScaleFactor` to get the current text scale factor and apply it to your `TextStyle`. This ensures that the text size automatically adjusts based on the user's device settings.

```dart
Text(
  'Hello World',
  style: TextStyle(
    fontSize: MediaQuery.of(context).textScaleFactor * 16, // Adjust the base font size according to the text scale factor
  ),
),
```

3. Wrap your `Text` widget with a `Builder` widget to access the `BuildContext` of the current `BuildContext`:

```dart
Builder(
  builder: (BuildContext context) {
    return Text(
      'Hello World',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: MediaQuery.of(context).textScaleFactor * 16,
      ),
    );
  },
),
```

By using `MediaQuery`, we can ensure that the text size adjusts dynamically based on the user's preferences or the screen size, resulting in a better user experience.

Remember to import the necessary packages, adjust the font size using `MediaQuery.of(context).textScaleFactor`, and wrap your widgets with a `MediaQuery` widget. Don't forget to experiment and test your UI on different screen sizes and orientations to ensure it's responsive and legible.
