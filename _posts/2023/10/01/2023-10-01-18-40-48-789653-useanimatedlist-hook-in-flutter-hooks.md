Flutter Hooks is a popular Flutter package that provides a set of hooks to use in your Flutter applications. One of the commonly used hooks in Flutter Hooks is `useAnimatedList`. In this blog post, we will explore the `useAnimatedList` hook and see how it can be used to create animated lists in Flutter.

## What is useAnimatedList?

The `useAnimatedList` hook in Flutter Hooks is a powerful hook that allows you to create and manage animated lists in your Flutter application. It provides a convenient way to add, remove, and update the items in a list with built-in animations. This hook is especially useful when you want to create dynamic lists that can be updated with animations in response to user interactions or data changes.

## How to use useAnimatedList

To use the `useAnimatedList` hook in your Flutter application, you first need to import the Flutter Hooks package and then use the hook in your widget. Here's an example of how you can use the `useAnimatedList` hook to create an animated list:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';

class AnimatedListExample extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final GlobalKey<AnimatedListState> _listKey = GlobalKey<AnimatedListState>();

    final items = <String>['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'];
    
    final listController = useAnimatedList(
      key: _listKey,
      initialItems: items,
      itemBuilder: (context, index, animation) {
        final item = items[index];
        return ListTile(
          title: Text(item),
        );
      },
    );

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Animated List Example'),
      ),
      body: AnimatedList(
        key: _listKey,
        initialItemCount: items.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index, animation) {
          return SizeTransition(
            sizeFactor: animation,
            child: listController[index],
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the example above, we create an `AnimatedList` widget and pass the `_listKey` and `initialItemCount` properties to it. We also define an `itemBuilder` function that is responsible for rendering each item in the list. Inside the `itemBuilder`, we render a `ListTile` widget with the item's text.

We then use the `useAnimatedList` hook and pass the `_listKey`, `initialItems`, and `itemBuilder` properties to it. The `useAnimatedList` hook returns a `listController` object, which we can use to add, remove, or update the items in the list.

Finally, we use the `listController` to get the animated list items and pass them to the `AnimatedList` widget. We also wrap the list items with `SizeTransition` to animate their appearance.

## Conclusion

The `useAnimatedList` hook in Flutter Hooks provides a powerful and convenient way to create animated lists in your Flutter applications. It allows you to easily add, remove, and update items in a list with built-in animations. By using this hook, you can create dynamic and interactive lists that respond to user interactions and data changes. Happy coding!
