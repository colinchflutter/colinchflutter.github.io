In the world of mobile app development, it's common to have background tasks that need to be executed at specific times or intervals. One such scenario is sending email notifications to users on a scheduled basis. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement email notification in scheduled tasks using Flutter and WorkManager.

## What is WorkManager?

WorkManager is an Android library that provides a flexible way to schedule tasks that need to run in the background, even if the app is not currently active. It is part of Android Jetpack and offers a powerful API for managing and scheduling background work.

## Setting up WorkManager

To get started, you need to add the WorkManager dependency to your Flutter project. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under `dependencies`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  workmanager: ^0.4.1
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to fetch and install the WorkManager package.

## Implementing email notification with WorkManager

To implement email notification using WorkManager, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Dart file, let's call it `email_notification_task.dart`, to define a worker class that will handle the email sending task.

2. Import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:workmanager/workmanager.dart';
import 'package:mailer/mailer.dart';
import 'package:mailer/smtp_server.dart';
```

3. Define the worker class with a `doWork` method:

```dart
class EmailNotificationTask extends Worker {
  @override
  Future<void> doWork() async {
    // Code to send email notification
  }
}
```

4. Configure the WorkManager in your Flutter app's entry point file, usually `main.dart`:

```dart
void main() {
  Workmanager.initialize(
    callbackDispatcher, // Callback function for handling tasks
    isInDebugMode: true  // Enable debug logs
  );

  // Start running your Flutter app
  runApp(MyApp());
}

void callbackDispatcher() {
  Workmanager.executeTask((taskName, inputData) async {
    switch (taskName) {
      case "email_notification_task":
        var emailTask = EmailNotificationTask();
        await emailTask.doWork();
        break;
    }

    return Future.value(true);
  });
}
```

5. Schedule the email notification task using WorkManager:

```dart
void scheduleEmailNotificationTask() {
  Workmanager.registerOneOffTask(
    "email_notification_task", // Unique identifier for the task
    "email_notification_task", // Name of the task
    inputData: <String, dynamic>{}, // Optional input data
  );
}
```

6. Finally, call the `scheduleEmailNotificationTask` method wherever you want to schedule the email notification task.

## Conclusion

By using WorkManager in combination with Flutter, you can easily implement email notification in scheduled tasks. WorkManager provides a robust and efficient way to handle background tasks, ensuring that your app can perform important tasks like sending emails even when the app is not in the foreground. With this implementation, you can enhance the user experience and keep your users engaged with timely email notifications.
