In Flutter, the `WillPopScope` widget is commonly used to handle system back button presses on Android devices. It allows you to define custom behavior when the back button is pressed, such as showing a confirmation dialog or navigating to a different screen.

Flutter Hooks is a library that provides various hooks, which are functions that allow you to use stateful logic in functional Flutter components. One of the hooks provided by Flutter Hooks is `useWillPopScope`, which makes it easy to implement the back button behavior using functional components.

## Installing Flutter Hooks

Before using the `useWillPopScope` hook, you'll need to install the Flutter Hooks library. Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_hooks: ^0.17.0
```

Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to download the dependencies.

## Using the `useWillPopScope` Hook

To use the `useWillPopScope` hook in your functional component, you need to import the Flutter Hooks library and use the `useWillPopScope` function. Here's an example of how to use it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';

class MyComponent extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final value = useMemoized(() => <some-value>);
  
    useWillPopScope(() {
      // Custom logic to handle back button press
      // Return true to allow the back button action or false to disable it
      return true;
    });

    return Container(
      // Your component code here
    );
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `useWillPopScope` hook is used inside the `build` method of a functional component (`MyComponent`) along with other hooks like `useMemoized`. Inside the `useWillPopScope` callback function, you can implement your custom logic for handling the back button press.

## Conclusion

The `useWillPopScope` hook provided by the Flutter Hooks library simplifies the implementation of the back button behavior in your Flutter applications. It allows you to handle system back button presses easily using functional components. By importing and using this hook, you can add custom behavior and improve the user experience of your Flutter app.
