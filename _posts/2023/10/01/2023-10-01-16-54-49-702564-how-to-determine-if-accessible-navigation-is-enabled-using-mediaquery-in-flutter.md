In Flutter, it is important to ensure that your app is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. One way to make your app more accessible is by enabling accessible navigation, which provides additional support for keyboard navigation and focus traversal order.

To determine if accessible navigation is enabled in Flutter, you can use the `MediaQuery` widget. The `MediaQuery` widget provides information about the current configuration, including the accessibility settings.

Here is an example of how you can determine if accessible navigation is enabled using `MediaQuery`:

1. Wrap your widget tree with a `MediaQuery` widget:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return MediaQuery(
    data: MediaQueryData(),
    child:  // your widget tree here
  );
}
```

2. Access the `MediaQuery` data using the static `MediaQuery.of(context)` method:

```dart
final mediaQueryData = MediaQuery.of(context);
```

3. Check the value of the `accessibleNavigation` property in the `mediaQueryData`:

```dart
final isAccessibleNavigationEnabled = mediaQueryData.accessibleNavigation;
```

4. Use the `isAccessibleNavigationEnabled` variable to conditionally render different parts of your widget tree based on the accessibility settings:

```dart
if (isAccessibleNavigationEnabled) {
  // render additional accessible navigation elements
} else {
  // render default navigation elements
}
```

By checking the value of `accessibleNavigation` property in the `MediaQuery` data, you can determine if accessible navigation is enabled in Flutter. This allows you to adapt your app's user interface to provide a better experience for users with disabilities.

Remember to include appropriate accessibility features and ensure that your app follows best practices for accessibility to provide an inclusive experience for all your users.
