When developing a mobile app, it's important to adapt to the user's device settings to provide a better user experience. One aspect to consider is the device's time format - whether it uses a 12-hour clock or a 24-hour clock.

In Flutter, you can determine if the device uses a 24-hour format by using the `MediaQuery` class. `MediaQuery` provides information about the current device, including its configuration.

To determine if the device uses a 24-hour format, you can use the `alwaysUse24HourFormat` property of `MediaQueryData`. Let's see an example of how to use it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final mediaQueryData = MediaQuery.of(context);
    final uses24HourFormat = mediaQueryData.alwaysUse24HourFormat;

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('24-Hour Format'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            uses24HourFormat ? 'Device uses 24-hour format' : 'Device uses 12-hour format',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we retrieve the `MediaQueryData` using `MediaQuery.of(context)`. We then access the `alwaysUse24HourFormat` property to determine if the device uses a 24-hour format or not. Based on this value, we display a corresponding message in the app's body.

Remember to wrap your widget with a `MediaQuery` widget ancestor to ensure that `MediaQueryData` is accessible. Typically, this is done at the root of your app in the `build` method of `MaterialApp`.

By utilizing `MediaQuery` in Flutter, you can easily determine if the device uses a 24-hour format and adjust your app's behavior accordingly. It ensures that your app aligns with the user's device preferences, providing a more intuitive experience.
