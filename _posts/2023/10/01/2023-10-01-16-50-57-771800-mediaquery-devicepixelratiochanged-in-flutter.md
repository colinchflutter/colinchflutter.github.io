Image rendering is a crucial aspect of building responsive user interfaces in Flutter. One scenario that often requires special attention is when the device pixel ratio changes. This can occur when the user adjusts the system's font size or when the app is displayed on different devices with varying pixel densities.

To ensure that our app's UI adapts seamlessly when the device's pixel ratio changes, we can make use of the `mediaQueryObserver` provided by Flutter. This observer allows us to detect such changes and update our UI accordingly.

First, we'll need to create a class that extends `WidgetsBindingObserver` to listen for pixel ratio changes. In this class, we'll implement the `didChangeMetrics` method to handle the devicePixelRatioChanged event:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';

class PixelRatioObserver extends WidgetsBindingObserver {
  @override
  void didChangeMetrics() {
    super.didChangeMetrics();
    if (WidgetsBinding.instance!.window != null) {
      final pixelRatio = WidgetsBinding.instance!.window.devicePixelRatio;
      // Update UI based on the new pixelRatio value
      // You can use setState or any other appropriate mechanism
      // for updating your UI here.
      print('Pixel ratio changed: $pixelRatio');
    }
  }
}
```

Next, we'll register our `PixelRatioObserver` class as the widget binding observer in the `main` method of our Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final observer = PixelRatioObserver();
  WidgetsBinding.instance!.addObserver(observer);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

With these changes in place, whenever the pixel ratio of the device changes, the `didChangeMetrics` method in our observer class will be triggered. Inside this method, you can update the UI based on the new pixel ratio value.

Remember to unregister the observer when it's no longer needed, to prevent any memory leaks. You can do this by calling `removeObserver` before removing the observer object.

By handling the `devicePixelRatioChanged` event using the `WidgetsBindingObserver` class, you can ensure that your Flutter app provides a consistent and responsive user experience across different devices and pixel densities.
