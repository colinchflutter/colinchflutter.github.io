Flutter Hooks is a powerful library that enhances the functionality of Flutter's widget framework. It provides a set of hooks, including the `useAnimatedDefaultTextStyleTween` hook, which allows developers to animate changes in `TextStyle` effortlessly. In this article, we will explore how to utilize the `useAnimatedDefaultTextStyleTween` hook to create smooth and dynamic text transitions in your Flutter applications.

## Getting Started

Before we dive into the details, ensure that you have Flutter Hooks added as a dependency in your project's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_hooks: ^0.18.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the latest dependencies.

## Animation Basics

To understand the `useAnimatedDefaultTextStyleTween` hook, let's first cover some basics of animating text styles in Flutter.

When animating `TextStyle` changes, you need two different styles - one representing the starting point and another for the ending point. Flutter then interpolates between these two styles to generate the necessary in-between styles for the animation.

Flutter Hooks simplifies the creation of these interpolated styles using the `useAnimatedDefaultTextStyleTween` hook.

## Using useAnimatedDefaultTextStyleTween

To start using the `useAnimatedDefaultTextStyleTween` hook, first import it into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';
```

Then, within your functional widget, create an instance of `TextStyleTween` using the `useAnimatedDefaultTextStyleTween` hook:

```dart
TextStyleTween textStyleTween = useAnimatedDefaultTextStyleTween(
  style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
);
```

Here, we define the starting `TextStyle` as `fontSize: 16`. You can customize this argument to suit your specific needs.

Next, to animate the `TextStyle` to a different value, use the `textStyleTween.animate` method:

```dart
AnimatedDefaultTextStyle(
  style: textStyleTween.animate(
    const TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
  ),
  child: const Text('Flutter Hooks Animations'),
),
```

Here, we provide an `AnimatedDefaultTextStyle` widget as the parent to the `Text` widget. The `style` parameter is set to the interpolated value returned by `textStyleTween.animate`. By providing a new `TextStyle` value, you trigger the animation.

## Conclusion

The `useAnimatedDefaultTextStyleTween` hook in Flutter Hooks simplifies the process of animating changes in `TextStyle`. By utilizing this hook, you can easily create smooth and dynamic text transitions in your Flutter applications.
