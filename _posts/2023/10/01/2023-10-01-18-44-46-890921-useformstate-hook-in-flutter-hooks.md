Flutter Hooks is a powerful extension to Flutter that allows you to write reusable and easy-to-understand code using hooks. Hooks provide a way to manage state in functional Flutter components. One of the commonly used hooks is `useFormState`, which simplifies handling form state in your Flutter applications.

In this blog post, we will walk you through the process of getting started with the `useFormState` hook and show you how to use it to manage form state effortlessly.

## Installation

Before using the `useFormState` hook, you need to install the `flutter_hooks` package. To include this package in your Flutter project, add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_hooks: ^0.16.0
```

Refer to the official [Flutter Hooks documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks) for the latest version of the package.

## Usage

Once you have installed the `flutter_hooks` package, you can import the necessary libraries in your Flutter component:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';
```

You can then start using the `useFormState` hook in your functional Flutter component:

```dart
Widget MyForm() {
  final formState = useFormState();
  
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(title: Text('My Form')),
    body: Form(
      child: Column(
        children: [
          TextFormField(
            onChanged: (value) => formState.setValue('username', value),
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Username'),
          ),
          TextFormField(
            onChanged: (value) => formState.setValue('password', value),
            decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Password'),
            obscureText: true,
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () => formState.submit(),
            child: Text('Submit'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

In the example above, we create a simple form with two text fields for username and password. We use the `useFormState` hook to manage the form state. The `formState` object returned by the hook provides methods and properties to handle form values and submissions.

- To set a form value, use `formState.setValue(key, value)`, where `key` is a unique identifier for the form field, and `value` is the new value for that form field.
- To submit the form, use `formState.submit()`. This will trigger any validation logic or submission handlers associated with the form.

## Summary

Using the `useFormState` hook in Flutter Hooks simplifies form state management in your Flutter applications. With this hook, you can easily handle form values and submissions without the need to create complex state management systems. Incorporate the `useFormState` hook in your Flutter projects for a cleaner and more efficient way to handle form state.
