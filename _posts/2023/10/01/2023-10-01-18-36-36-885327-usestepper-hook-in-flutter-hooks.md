Flutter Hooks is a powerful library that allows you to efficiently manage state in your Flutter applications using hooks. One of the useful hooks provided by Flutter Hooks is `useStepper`. In this blog post, we will explore how to use the `useStepper` hook to implement a stepper widget in Flutter.

## What is `useStepper`?

The `useStepper` hook is designed to provide a simple way to manage the state of a stepper widget. It allows you to easily keep track of the current step of the stepper, as well as handle navigation to the next and previous steps.

## Installation

Before we start using the `useStepper` hook, we need to make sure that we have the Flutter Hooks package added to our project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_hooks: ^0.18.0
```

Save the file and run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

## Implementation

Now that we have Flutter Hooks installed, we can proceed with using the `useStepper` hook. Here's an example of how to implement a simple stepper widget using the `useStepper` hook:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Stepper Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: StepperWidget(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class StepperWidget extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final stepper = useStepper(initialStep: 0);

    return Stepper(
      currentStep: stepper.activeStep,
      onStepContinue: stepper.increment,
      onStepCancel: stepper.decrement,
      steps: [
        Step(
          title: Text('Step 1'),
          content: Text('This is step 1'),
          isActive: stepper.activeStep == 0,
        ),
        Step(
          title: Text('Step 2'),
          content: Text('This is step 2'),
          isActive: stepper.activeStep == 1,
        ),
        Step(
          title: Text('Step 3'),
          content: Text('This is step 3'),
          isActive: stepper.activeStep == 2,
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In the above example, we start by importing the required packages, including `flutter_hooks`. We then define our `StepperWidget` as a `HookWidget` and use the `useStepper` hook to manage the state of the stepper.

We pass the `initialStep` argument to `useStepper` to set the initial active step. We store the `useStepper` result in the `stepper` variable, which contains the active step and the logic to handle incrementing and decrementing the step.

The `Stepper` widget is then rendered using the `currentStep` property from `useStepper`, which reflects the active step. We also hook up the `onStepContinue` and `onStepCancel` callbacks to the `increment` and `decrement` methods from the `stepper` object.

Finally, we define the steps of the stepper using the `Step` widget, with the `isActive` property based on the `activeStep` value from the `stepper` object.

### Conclusion

The `useStepper` hook provided by Flutter Hooks makes it easy and intuitive to manage the state of a stepper widget in your Flutter applications. By using this hook, we can simplify the code and improve the overall readability and maintainability of our app.

Using Flutter Hooks in conjunction with `useStepper` allows us to write cleaner code while still leveraging the power of Flutter's UI framework.
