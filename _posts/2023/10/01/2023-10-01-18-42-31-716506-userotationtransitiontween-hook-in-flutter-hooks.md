Flutter Hooks is a library that provides a way to use stateful hooks in your Flutter applications. One of the helpful hooks included in Flutter Hooks is the `useRotationTransitionTween` hook. This hook allows you to easily create a rotation transition animation using a `Tween`.

## Installation

To use Flutter Hooks in your Flutter project, add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_hooks: ^0.20.0
```

Then, run `flutter packages get` to fetch the dependency.

## Usage

To use the `useRotationTransitionTween` hook, import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';
```

Next, create a stateful widget and use the `HookWidget` as the base class:

```dart
class RotationTransitionWidget extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final AnimationController controller = useAnimationController(duration: Duration(seconds: 2));
    final animation = useRotationTransitionTween(
      controller: controller,
      from: 0,
      to: 2.0 * 3.14,
    );

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Rotation Transition'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: AnimatedBuilder(
          animation: controller,
          builder: (BuildContext context, Widget child) {
            return Transform.rotate(
              angle: animation.value,
              child: Text(
                'Flutter Hooks',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the `build` method, we first define an `AnimationController` using the `useAnimationController` hook. This hook handles the lifecycle of the animation controller automatically.

Then, we use the `useRotationTransitionTween` hook to create a rotation transition animation. We pass the animation controller, `from` and `to` values, and it returns an `Animation<double>` that represents the transition.

Finally, in the widget's `build` method, we use the `AnimatedBuilder` widget to rebuild the UI whenever the animation value changes. Inside the builder, we use the `Transform.rotate` widget to apply the rotation to the child widget.

## Conclusion

The `useRotationTransitionTween` hook in Flutter Hooks provides an easy way to create rotation transition animations in your Flutter applications. With its simple API and integration with other hooks, you can leverage the power of hooks to create dynamic and interactive user experiences in your Flutter projects.
