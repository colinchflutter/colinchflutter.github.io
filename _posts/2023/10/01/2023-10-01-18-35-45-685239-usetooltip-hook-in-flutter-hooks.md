Flutter Hooks is a powerful package that provides hooks to easily manage state in Flutter applications. One useful hook that it offers is the `useTooltip` hook, which allows you to add tooltips to your Flutter widgets effortlessly. In this blog post, we will explore how to use the `useTooltip` hook in Flutter Hooks.

## Installation

Before we dive into using the `useTooltip` hook, make sure you have Flutter Hooks installed in your project. You can add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_hooks: ^0.18.0
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

## Usage

To start using the `useTooltip` hook, you need to import it from the `flutter_hooks` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';
```

Then, within your functional widget, you can use the `useTooltip` hook like this:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final tooltipController = useTooltipController();

  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('Flutter Hooks Tooltip Example'),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: Tooltip(
        message: 'This is a tooltip',
        child: GestureDetector(
          child: Text(
            'Tap me to show tooltip',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
          ),
          onTap: tooltipController.showTooltip,
          onTapUp: tooltipController.hideTooltip,
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

In the above code, we first initialize a `tooltipController` using the `useTooltipController` hook. This controller will be responsible for showing and hiding the tooltip.

Within the `GestureDetector` widget, we wrap our desired child widget with a `Tooltip` widget. We specify the message we want to display in the tooltip using the `message` property. The `onTap` and `onTapUp` callbacks of the `GestureDetector` are used to show and hide the tooltip respectively.

## Customization

The `useTooltip` hook allows further customization of the tooltip appearance. You can modify the tooltip's background color, text style, and animation duration by passing arguments to the corresponding hook function calls. For example, to change the background color of the tooltip, you can use `useTooltipColor`, and for text style customization, you can use `useTooltipTextStyle`. 

```dart
final tooltipColor = useTooltipColor(Colors.blue);
final tooltipTextStyle = useTooltipTextStyle(TextStyle(color: Colors.white));
```

## Conclusion

The `useTooltip` hook provided by Flutter Hooks simplifies the process of adding tooltips to your Flutter widgets. It allows you to easily show and hide tooltips with just a few lines of code. Additionally, the customization options offered by the hook give you control over the tooltip's appearance. Start using the `useTooltip` hook in your Flutter Hooks projects to enhance the user experience and provide helpful information to your users.
