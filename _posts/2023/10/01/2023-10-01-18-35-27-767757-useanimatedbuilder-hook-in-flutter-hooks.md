Flutter Hooks is a powerful library that helps streamline state management in Flutter applications. One of the useful hooks provided by Flutter Hooks is the `useAnimatedBuilder` hook. In this blog post, we will explore how to use the `useAnimatedBuilder` hook to create animated UI components in your Flutter app.

## What is the `useAnimatedBuilder` Hook?

The `useAnimatedBuilder` hook is a Flutter Hook that allows you to create animated UI components using the `AnimatedBuilder` widget. The `AnimatedBuilder` widget provides a way to interpolate an animation over a range of values, allowing you to create smooth and interactive animations in your Flutter app.

## How to Use the `useAnimatedBuilder` Hook

To use the `useAnimatedBuilder` hook, you first need to import the `flutter_hooks` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';
```

Next, you can use the `useAnimatedBuilder` hook in your Flutter function component, just like any other hook. Here's an example of how to use the `useAnimatedBuilder` hook:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';

class MyAnimatedComponent extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    AnimationController controller = useAnimationController(duration: Duration(seconds: 1));

    return useAnimatedBuilder(
      animation: controller,
      builder: (context, child) {
        return Opacity(
          opacity: controller.value,
          child: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In the above example, we create an `AnimationController` using the `useAnimationController` hook and set the duration to 1 second. This controller will control the animation.

We then use the `useAnimatedBuilder` hook, passing the animation controller and the builder function. The builder function is called every time the animation value changes. In this example, we use the animated value to control the opacity of the container, creating a fade-in effect.

## Conclusion

The `useAnimatedBuilder` hook in Flutter Hooks simplifies the process of creating animated UI components in Flutter. By leveraging the power of the `AnimatedBuilder` widget, you can easily create smooth and interactive animations in your Flutter app.

Using the `useAnimatedBuilder` hook is just one of the many ways Flutter Hooks helps improve state management in Flutter applications. So if you are looking for a cleaner and more efficient way to handle state in Flutter, give Flutter Hooks a try!
