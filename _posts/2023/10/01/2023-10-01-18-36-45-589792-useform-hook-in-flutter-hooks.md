Flutter Hooks is a great package that allows us to use hooks in Flutter, similar to React Hooks. In this blog post, we will explore the `useForm` hook provided by Flutter Hooks and see how it can simplify form handling in our Flutter applications.

## What is the useForm hook?

The `useForm` hook is a powerful tool that helps us manage form state in our Flutter applications. It provides a simple and intuitive way to handle form inputs, validation, and submission.

## How to use the useForm hook?

To start using the `useForm` hook, we need to import it from the `flutter_hooks` package. Here's an example of how we can use it in our Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';

Widget MyForm() {
  final form = useForm();

  return Form(
    key: form.formKey,
    child: Column(
      children: [
        TextFormField(
          decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Name'),
          validator: form.validateAndSave((value) {
            if (value.isEmpty) {
              return 'Name is required';
            }
  
            return null;
          }),
        ),
        RaisedButton(
          child: Text('Submit'),
          onPressed: form.submit,
        ),
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```

In this example, we first create an instance of the `useForm` hook and assign it to the `form` variable. The hook provides us with a `formKey` that we can use to wrap our `Form` widget. This key is essential for form validation and submission.

We then use the `validateAndSave` method provided by the hook as the `validator` for our `TextFormField`. This method takes a function and returns a validation error message if the validation fails.

Finally, we use the `submit` method provided by the hook as the `onPressed` handler for our `RaisedButton`. This method executes the form submission logic.

## Conclusion

The `useForm` hook in Flutter Hooks is a powerful tool that simplifies form handling in Flutter applications. It provides an intuitive interface to manage form state, validation, and submission. By using this hook, we can write cleaner and more maintainable code for handling forms.

If you haven't tried Flutter Hooks yet, I highly recommend giving it a go. It can significantly enhance your Flutter development experience and make your code more efficient.
