When developing a Flutter application, it is important to make it responsive and adaptive to different devices. One aspect of device adaptivity is understanding the pixel ratio of the device's screen. The pixel ratio determines how many physical pixels are used to display a single logical pixel.

To retrieve the device's pixel ratio value in Flutter, we can utilize the MediaQuery class. This class provides access to various information about the device's screen, including the pixel ratio.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to get the device's pixel ratio using MediaQuery in Flutter:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final mediaQueryData = MediaQuery.of(context);
    final pixelRatio = mediaQueryData.devicePixelRatio;

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Device Pixel Ratio'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Pixel Ratio: $pixelRatio',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, we first import the necessary packages and create a simple Flutter application. Inside the `build()` method of `MyApp` class, we retrieve the `MediaQueryData` object using `MediaQuery.of(context)`. This object provides access to various properties related to the device's screen.

We then extract the `devicePixelRatio` property from the `mediaQueryData`, which contains the pixel ratio value. Finally, we display the pixel ratio value using a `Text` widget in the `body` of our `Scaffold`.

By running this code, you will get the device's pixel ratio displayed on the screen. The pixel ratio value can help in designing UI elements and providing proper scaling for different devices.
