Flutter Hooks is a powerful library that provides additional functionality and simplifies state management in Flutter applications. One of the commonly used hooks in Flutter Hooks is the `useAnimatedDefaultTextStyle` hook, which allows us to create animated text styles in a convenient and efficient way.

## Installation

First, make sure that you have the Flutter Hooks package added to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_hooks: ^0.18.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

## Usage

To use the `useAnimatedDefaultTextStyle` hook, you need to import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';
```

Next, create a widget that will animate the text style using the hook:

```dart
class AnimatedTextStyleWidget extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final textStyle = useAnimatedDefaultTextStyle(
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.black),
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 1),
    );

    return AnimatedDefaultTextStyle(
      child: Text('Example Text'),
      style: textStyle,
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 1),
    );
  }
}
```

In the `build` method, we use the `useAnimatedDefaultTextStyle` hook to obtain the animated text style. We specify the initial style using the `style` parameter. Then, we pass this animated style to the `AnimatedDefaultTextStyle` widget along with the desired child widget (in this case, a `Text` widget).

Finally, we define the duration using the `duration` parameter to control the animation speed.

## Customizing the Animation

The `useAnimatedDefaultTextStyle` hook provides several parameters to customize the animation according to your needs:

- `style`: The base style for the animated text. You can provide any `TextStyle` parameters such as `fontSize`, `color`, `fontWeight`, etc.
- `duration`: The duration of the animation.
- `curve`: The curve used for the animation interpolation. Default value is `Curves.linear`.
- `onEnd`: A callback function that will be called when the animation completes.

By adjusting these parameters, you can create various types of text style animations that suit your application's design.

## Conclusion

The `useAnimatedDefaultTextStyle` hook in Flutter Hooks simplifies the process of creating animated text styles. It allows you to define the desired style and animate it with ease. By using this hook, you can enhance the visual appeal of your Flutter applications with animated text effects.
