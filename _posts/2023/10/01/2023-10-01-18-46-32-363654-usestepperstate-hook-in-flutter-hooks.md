Flutter Hooks is a powerful package that extends the functionality of Flutter's state management system by introducing hooks. Hooks are a lightweight way to manage stateful logic in a functional manner. In this blog post, we will explore the `useStepperState` hook, which provides an easy way to manage the state of a stepper widget in Flutter using Flutter Hooks.

## Getting Started

Before we begin, ensure that you have Flutter Hooks added as a dependency in your Flutter project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_hooks: ^0.18.0
```

Once you have added the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## The `useStepperState` Hook

The `useStepperState` hook is designed to simplify the management of state in a stepper widget. It takes in two arguments - the number of steps in the stepper and an optional initial step value. The hook returns a state value and two state update functions, `nextStep` and `prevStep`, which can be used to navigate through the steps.

Here's an example of how to use the `useStepperState` hook:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';

Widget MyStepper() {
  final state = useStepperState(3); // Using 3 as the number of steps

  return Column(
    children: [
      Stepper(
        currentStep: state.currentStep,
        onStepContinue: () => state.nextStep(),
        onStepCancel: () => state.prevStep(),
        steps: [
          Step(
            title: Text('Step 1'),
            content: Text('This is step 1'),
          ),
          Step(
            title: Text('Step 2'),
            content: Text('This is step 2'),
          ),
          Step(
            title: Text('Step 3'),
            content: Text('This is step 3'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
      Text('Current Step: ${state.currentStep}')
    ],
  );
}
```

In the example above, we create a state variable `state` using the `useStepperState` hook. We pass in the number of steps as the argument. We then use the `currentStep` value from the state to set the `currentStep` property of the `Stepper` widget. We also provide the `nextStep` and `prevStep` functions from the state as the `onStepContinue` and `onStepCancel` callbacks respectively.

Finally, we display the current step value using a `Text` widget.

## Conclusion

The `useStepperState` hook in Flutter Hooks provides an elegant and concise way to manage the state of a stepper widget in Flutter. By using this hook, we can easily handle navigation between steps and keep our code clean and maintainable.

Give the `useStepperState` hook a try in your Flutter project and experience the power of Flutter Hooks in simplifying your state management code.
