In the world of mobile applications, it is crucial to handle network connectivity changes gracefully. This becomes even more important when performing scheduled tasks in the background. In this article, we will explore how to handle network connectivity changes when using WorkManager in Flutter.

## What is WorkManager?

WorkManager is a powerful library provided by the Android Jetpack suite that allows developers to schedule tasks to run in the background, even when the app is not actively running. It offers features like handling network connectivity changes, setting task constraints, and running tasks at specific intervals.

## Why do we need to handle network connectivity changes?

When performing background tasks, it is essential to consider the network connectivity of the device. If the device loses network connection while executing a task, we might want to pause or reschedule the task until the connection is available again. By handling network connectivity changes, we ensure that our scheduled tasks are executed in the most efficient and reliable manner.

## Implementing network connectivity changes handling in WorkManager

To handle network connectivity changes in WorkManager for Flutter, we can follow these steps:

### 1. Install the required dependencies

First, we need to add the `workmanager` and `connectivity` packages to our Flutter project. These packages provide the necessary tools for handling background tasks and monitoring network connectivity, respectively. To install these packages, add the following lines to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```markdown
```
```dart
dependencies:
  workmanager: ^x.x.x
  connectivity: ^x.x.x
```

Note: Replace `x.x.x` with the latest version of each package.

### 2. Create a callback function

Next, create a callback function that will be called whenever there is a network connectivity change. This function will be responsible for handling the appropriate action based on the connectivity status. For example, you can pause the task if the connection is lost, and resume it when the connection is restored.

```dart
void networkConnectivityCallback(bool isConnected) {
  if (isConnected) {
    // Perform actions when network connection is available
    // Resume scheduled task or proceed with next steps
  } else {
    // Perform actions when network connection is lost
    // Pause or reschedule the task until connection is restored
  }
}
```

### 3. Register the network connectivity listener

In your main application file (usually `main.dart`), register the network connectivity listener and associate it with the callback function. This will allow you to receive updates whenever the network connectivity changes.

```dart
import 'package:connectivity/connectivity.dart';

void main() {
  // ...

  final connectivity = Connectivity();

  connectivity.onConnectivityChanged.listen(networkConnectivityCallback);

  // ...
}
```

### 4. Schedule background tasks using WorkManager

Finally, integrate WorkManager into your Flutter app to schedule and execute the background tasks. WorkManager provides an easy-to-use API for managing and monitoring tasks. You can define constraints, set intervals, and handle retry policies. For detailed information on how to schedule tasks using WorkManager, refer to the [official documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/workmanager).

## Conclusion

By implementing network connectivity changes handling in WorkManager for Flutter, we can ensure that our scheduled tasks are executed reliably, even in challenging network conditions. The combination of WorkManager and the connectivity package makes it easy to manage background tasks and provide a seamless user experience.

With these steps, you are now prepared to handle network connectivity changes efficiently in your scheduled tasks using WorkManager for Flutter.
