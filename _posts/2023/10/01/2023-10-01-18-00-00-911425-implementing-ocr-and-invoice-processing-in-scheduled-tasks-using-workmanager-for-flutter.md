With the rise of mobile applications, the need for automating tasks such as OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and invoice processing has become crucial. Flutter, being a cross-platform framework, provides a convenient way to develop such applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement OCR and invoice processing in Flutter using scheduled tasks with WorkManager.

## What is WorkManager?

WorkManager is an Android library that helps execute background tasks, even when the app is not actively running. It allows developers to schedule asynchronous tasks that can run under various conditions, such as device idle state or network availability. This makes it an ideal tool for automating resource-intensive tasks like OCR and invoice processing.

## Setting Up the Project

To get started, create a new Flutter project and add the `workmanager` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  workmanager: ^x.x.x
```

Replace `x.x.x` with the latest version of the `workmanager` package.

Once the dependencies are added, run `flutter pub get` to download and install them.

## Implementing OCR

To perform OCR, you can use the `flutter_ocr` package, which provides the necessary tools for extracting text from images. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_ocr: ^x.x.x
```

Replace `x.x.x` with the latest version of the `flutter_ocr` package.

To use the `flutter_ocr` package, create a new instance of the `FlutterOcr` class and pass the image file path to perform OCR:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_ocr/flutter_ocr.dart';

final flutterOcr = new FlutterOcr();

Future<String> performOCR(String imagePath) async {
  final result = await flutterOcr.recognizeText(imagePath);
  return result;
}
```

## Invoice Processing

After extracting the text using OCR, the next step is to process the invoice data. Depending on your specific requirements, you can parse the extracted text to obtain the necessary information such as invoice number, date, and amount.

Here is an example of how you can use regular expressions to extract invoice data:

```dart
import 'dart:core';

final invoicePattern = RegExp(r'Invoice Number:\s*(\d+)', caseSensitive: false);
final datePattern = RegExp(r'Date:\s*(\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{4})', caseSensitive: false);
final amountPattern = RegExp(r'Amount:\s*\$*(\d*\.*\d+)', caseSensitive: false);

void processInvoice(String invoiceText) {
  final invoiceNumber = invoicePattern.firstMatch(invoiceText)?.group(1);
  final invoiceDate = datePattern.firstMatch(invoiceText)?.group(1);
  final invoiceAmount = amountPattern.firstMatch(invoiceText)?.group(1);

  // Do further processing with the extracted data
}
```

## Scheduling Tasks with WorkManager

To schedule OCR and invoice processing tasks using WorkManager, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `background_tasks.dart` and import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:workmanager/workmanager.dart';

import 'invoice_processing.dart';
import 'ocr.dart';
```

2. Initialize WorkManager in the `main()` function of your Flutter app:

```dart
void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  Workmanager.initialize(callbackDispatcher);
  Workmanager.registerOneOffTask('ocr_task', 'ocrTask');
  Workmanager.registerOneOffTask('invoice_processing_task', 'invoiceProcessingTask');
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

3. Define the callbacks for the OCR and invoice processing tasks in the `background_tasks.dart` file:

```dart
void callbackDispatcher() {
  Workmanager.executeTask((task, inputData) {
    switch (task) {
      case 'ocrTask':
        final imagePath = inputData['imagePath'];
        performOCR(imagePath).then((result) {
          // Process the extracted text or trigger the invoice processing task
        });
        break;
      case 'invoiceProcessingTask':
        final invoiceText = inputData['invoiceText'];
        processInvoice(invoiceText);
        break;
    }
    return Future.value(true);
  });
}

void ocrTask() async {
  final imagePath = ''; // Path to the image file
  final inputData = {'imagePath': imagePath};

  await Workmanager.registerOneOffTask('ocr_task', 'ocrTask', inputData: inputData);
}

void invoiceProcessingTask() async {
  final invoiceText = ''; // Extracted text from OCR
  final inputData = {'invoiceText': invoiceText};

  await Workmanager.registerOneOffTask('invoice_processing_task', 'invoiceProcessingTask', inputData: inputData);
}
```

4. Invoke the tasks wherever needed in your Flutter app:

```dart
ocrTask(); // Schedule OCR task
invoiceProcessingTask(); // Schedule invoice processing task
```

## Conclusion

By utilizing scheduled tasks with WorkManager in Flutter, you can automate OCR and invoice processing to improve efficiency and productivity in your mobile applications. WorkManager provides a robust and flexible way to execute these resource-intensive tasks in the background, even when your app is not actively running. Experiment with the code provided and customize it according to your specific requirements to achieve seamless automation in your app. Happy coding!
