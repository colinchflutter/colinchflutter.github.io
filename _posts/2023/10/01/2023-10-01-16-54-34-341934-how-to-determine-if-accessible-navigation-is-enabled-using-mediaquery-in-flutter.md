In Flutter, you can use the `MediaQuery` class to get information about the current device and app configuration. This includes determining if accessible navigation is enabled, which is particularly important for creating inclusive user experiences. In this blog post, we will explore how to use `MediaQuery` to check if accessible navigation is enabled in a Flutter app.

## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the code, make sure that you have Flutter installed and set up on your machine.

## Steps to Determine if Accessible Navigation is Enabled

1. Import the Flutter material package by adding this line of code at the top of your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

2. Inside your Flutter widget, you can access the current `MediaQueryData` using `MediaQuery.of(context)`.
3. Call the `alwaysUse24HourFormat` property on `MediaQueryData` to determine if the user has enabled accessible navigation. If the value is `true`, it means that accessible navigation is enabled.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to check if accessible navigation is enabled using `MediaQuery`:

```dart
bool isAccessibleNavigationEnabled(BuildContext context) {
  final MediaQueryData mediaQueryData = MediaQuery.of(context);
  return mediaQueryData.alwaysUse24HourFormat;
}
```

4. To use this method in your app, simply call `isAccessibleNavigationEnabled` and pass the context as an argument. This will return a boolean value indicating whether accessible navigation is enabled or not.

```dart
bool accessibleNavigationEnabled = isAccessibleNavigationEnabled(context);
```

## Conclusion
By using `MediaQuery` in Flutter, you can easily determine if accessible navigation is enabled in your app. This allows you to create a more inclusive user experience by adapting your app's navigation and interface accordingly.

Remember that accessibility is an important aspect of app development, and considering the needs of users with disabilities can greatly enhance the usability and effectiveness of your application.
