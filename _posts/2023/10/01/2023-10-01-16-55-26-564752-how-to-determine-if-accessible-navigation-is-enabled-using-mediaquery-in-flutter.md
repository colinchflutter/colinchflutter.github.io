When building a Flutter app, it's important to consider accessibility and provide proper navigation options for users with disabilities. One way to enhance the accessibility of your app is by enabling accessible navigation features based on the user's device settings. 

In Flutter, you can determine if accessible navigation is enabled using the `MediaQuery` class. The `MediaQuery` class provides access to the current configuration of the app's media, including information about the user's device settings such as text scaling factor, brightness, and accessibility features.

To check if accessible navigation is enabled, you can make use of the `alwaysUse24HourFormat` property from the `MediaQueryData` class. This property returns a boolean value indicating whether the system navigation controls should always be displayed in a 24-hour format.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to determine if accessible navigation is enabled using `MediaQuery` in Flutter:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class AccessibleNavigationCheck extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    bool isAccessibleNavigationEnabled = MediaQuery.of(context).alwaysUse24HourFormat;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Accessible Navigation Check'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          isAccessibleNavigationEnabled
              ? 'Accessible navigation is enabled'
              : 'Accessible navigation is disabled',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, `MediaQuery.of(context)` retrieves the `MediaQueryData` object from the current `BuildContext`. The `alwaysUse24HourFormat` property is accessed from the `MediaQueryData` object to determine if accessible navigation is enabled. The result is displayed on the screen using a `Text` widget.

Remember to import the necessary Flutter dependencies and include the `AccessibleNavigationCheck` widget in your app's main widget tree.

By using this approach, you can dynamically adapt your app's navigation options to accommodate users with accessible navigation enabled on their devices.
