In Flutter Hooks, the `useGestureDetector` hook allows you to easily add gesture recognition to your Flutter application. This hook provides a way to detect and respond to various touch events such as taps, swipes, drags, and more. Using the `useGestureDetector` hook, you can create interactive and dynamic user experiences with minimal effort.

## Installation

To use the `useGestureDetector` hook, you need to add the `flutter_hooks` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_hooks: ^0.18.0
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the latest package.

## Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the `useGestureDetector` hook in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final _position = useState(Offset(0, 0));
  
    void _onPanUpdate(DragUpdateDetails details) {
      _position.value += details.delta;
    }
  
    return GestureDetector(
      onPanUpdate: _onPanUpdate,
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Gesture Detector'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
            color: Colors.blue,
            alignment: Alignment.center,
            child: Text(
              'Drag me',
              style: TextStyle(
                color: Colors.white,
                fontSize: 20,
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () => _position.value = Offset(0, 0),
          child: Icon(Icons.refresh),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above example, we define a `useState` hook to keep track of the current position. When the user drags on the `Container` widget, the `_onPanUpdate` function is called, updating the state with the new position.

The `useGestureDetector` hook works in a similar way as the `GestureDetector` widget. You can provide callback functions for various gestures, such as `onPanUpdate`, `onTap`, `onDoubleTap`, etc.

## Conclusion

Using the `useGestureDetector` hook in Flutter Hooks simplifies the process of adding gesture recognition to your application. By providing callback functions for various touch events, you can create interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
