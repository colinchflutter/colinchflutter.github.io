In Flutter, we can apply linear masks to our widgets using the SkiaShadersMask class. This allows us to create interesting visual effects by defining a gradient and using it as a mask on our widgets. In this blog post, we will explore how to use SkiaShadersMask to apply linear masks in Flutter.

## What is SkiaShadersMask?

SkiaShadersMask is a class provided by the Flutter framework that allows us to apply shaders as masks on our widgets. A shader represents a gradient or texture that can be used to fill a shape or image. By using SkiaShadersMask, we can create custom masks using linear gradients.

## Implementing linear masks

To apply a linear mask using SkiaShadersMask, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Import the required packages

Import the following packages in your Flutter project:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/rendering.dart';
import 'dart:ui' as ui show ImageFilter;
```

### Step 2: Create a linear gradient

Create a linear gradient using the `LinearGradient` class. Specify the start and end points of the gradient along with the colors.

```dart
final gradient = LinearGradient(
  begin: Alignment.topLeft,
  end: Alignment.bottomRight,
  colors: [Colors.red, Colors.blue],
);
```

### Step 3: Create a SkiaShadersMask

Next, create a `SkiaShadersMask` object and pass the linear gradient as its parameter.

```dart
final mask = SkiaShadersMask(gradient.createShader(Rect.zero));
```

### Step 4: Apply the mask to a widget

Apply the mask to a widget by using the `child` property of the `Container` widget. The `mask` property of the `Container` widget takes the `mask` object created in the previous step.

```dart
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    shape: BoxShape.circle,
    color: Colors.white,
    mask: mask,
  ),
  child: FlutterLogo(size: 200),
),
```

### Step 5: Run the app

Run the app, and you will see the widget with the linear mask applied.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to apply linear masks using the SkiaShadersMask class in Flutter. By creating a linear gradient and using it as a mask on a widget, we can achieve interesting visual effects. Experiment with different gradients and shapes to create stunning UIs in your Flutter apps.
