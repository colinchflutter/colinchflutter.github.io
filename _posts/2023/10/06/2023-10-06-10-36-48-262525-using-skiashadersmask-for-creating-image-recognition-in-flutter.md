In this tutorial, we will explore how to use `SkiaShadersMask` in Flutter to create image recognition capabilities in your app. `SkiaShadersMask` is a powerful feature in the Skia graphics library that allows you to apply masks to images, enabling you to detect and recognize specific patterns or objects within an image.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of Flutter and Dart programming

## Setting up the Project

To begin, create a new Flutter project by running the following command in your terminal:

```
flutter create image_recognition
```

Next, navigate to the project directory:

```
cd image_recognition
```

Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  skia_shaders_mask: ^0.1.0
```

Save the file and run the following command to fetch the dependency:

```
flutter pub get
```

## Implementing Image Recognition

We can now move on to the implementation of image recognition using `SkiaShadersMask`. 

First, import the required packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:skia_shaders_mask/skia_shaders_mask.dart';
```

Next, create a new Flutter widget for the image recognition screen:

```dart
class ImageRecognitionScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImageRecognitionScreenState createState() => _ImageRecognitionScreenState();
}

class _ImageRecognitionScreenState extends State<ImageRecognitionScreen> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Recognition'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RaisedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Call the image recognition function
            recognizeImage();
          },
          child: Text('Recognize Image'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  void recognizeImage() {
    // Add your implementation code here
  }
}
```

Inside the `recognizeImage` function, we will write the code for image recognition using `SkiaShadersMask`. 

```dart
void recognizeImage() {
    // Load the image
    final image = ExactAssetImage('assets/sample_image.png');
    
    // Create the shader using SkiaShadersMask library
    final shader = SkiaShadersMask.fromImage(image);
    
    // Add the recognition logic here using the shader
    
    // Display the results
}
```

Replace `assets/sample_image.png` with the path to your sample image file. 

You can now add your custom image recognition logic using the `shader` object created from the image. You can refer to the SkiaShadersMask documentation for more information on advanced image recognition techniques.

Finally, display the results on the screen or update the UI based on the recognition results.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to use `SkiaShadersMask` in Flutter to create image recognition capabilities in your app. With the power of Skia graphics library, you can now detect and recognize specific patterns or objects within images. Experiment with different recognition techniques and build amazing image recognition features in your Flutter applications.
