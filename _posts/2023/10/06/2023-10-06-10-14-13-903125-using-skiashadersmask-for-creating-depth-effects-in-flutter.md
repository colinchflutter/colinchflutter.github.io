In Flutter, you can create visually appealing depth effects by utilizing the SkiaShadersMask module. Skia is a powerful graphics library that Flutter uses for rendering UI elements. By applying a mask shader to a widget, you can create depth effects that give the illusion of elevation and dimensionality. In this blog post, we will explore how to use the SkiaShadersMask module to add depth effects to your Flutter applications.

## What is SkiaShadersMask?

SkiaShadersMask is a module in the Skia library that provides various shader effects to be applied to graphical objects. One such effect is the ability to apply a mask shader, which allows you to define a pattern or a shape that will be used to mask the content of a widget. By using different mask shaders, you can achieve various depth effects like shadows, gradients, and more.

## Adding Depth Effects using SkiaShadersMask

To start using SkiaShadersMask in your Flutter application, you need to add the skia package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  skia: ^0.3.0
```

After adding the package, you can import the necessary classes in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:skia/skia.dart' as skia;
```

### Creating a Shadow Effect

One of the most common depth effects is adding a shadow to a widget. With SkiaShadersMask, you can easily achieve this effect. Here's an example of how you can create a shadow effect using the `ShaderMask` widget:

```dart
Shader shadowShader = skia.ImageShader.fromColors(
  skia.Color.fromARGB(100, 0, 0, 0),
  skia.Color.fromARGB(0, 0, 0, 0),
);

Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ShaderMask(
    shaderCallback: (Rect bounds) {
      return shadowShader;
    },
    child: Container(
      width: 200,
      height: 200,
      color: Colors.blue,
    ),
  );
}
```

In the above example, we create a `Shader` object called `shadowShader` with a gradient from semi-opaque black to transparent black. We then use this shader with the `ShaderMask` widget to apply the shadow effect to the `Container` widget.

### Applying Gradients

Another popular depth effect is the use of gradients to create a sense of depth. With SkiaShadersMask, you can easily apply gradients to your widgets. Here's an example of how you can create a gradient effect using the `ShaderMask` widget:

```dart
Shader gradientShader = skia.Gradient.linear(
  [Offset(0, 0), Offset(0, 200)],
  [Colors.red, Colors.blue],
);

Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ShaderMask(
    shaderCallback: (Rect bounds) {
      return gradientShader;
    },
    child: Container(
      width: 200,
      height: 200,
      color: Colors.blue,
    ),
  );
}
```

In the above example, we create a `Shader` object called `gradientShader` with a linear gradient from red to blue. We then use this shader with the `ShaderMask` widget to apply the gradient effect to the `Container` widget.

## Conclusion

By utilizing the SkiaShadersMask module in Flutter, you can easily add depth effects to your applications. Whether you want to create shadows, gradients, or other effects, SkiaShadersMask provides a flexible and powerful solution. Experiment with different mask shaders and unleash your creativity to create stunning UI elements with depth and dimensionality.
