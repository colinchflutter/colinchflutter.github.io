Flutter is a cross-platform framework that allows you to build beautiful and responsive user interfaces for mobile and web applications. One of the many powerful features of Flutter is its ability to work with graphics and images.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the `SkiaShadersMask` class in Flutter to create stunning image panoramas. The `SkiaShadersMask` class is provided by the [flutter_skia](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_skia) package, which leverages the powerful Skia library to manipulate images and graphics in Flutter.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can check if you have Flutter installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
flutter --version
```

If Flutter is not installed, you can follow the official Flutter installation guide for your operating system.

## Installing the flutter_skia package

To use the `SkiaShadersMask` class, we need to add the `flutter_skia` package as a dependency in our Flutter project.

Open your project's `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_skia: ^0.1.0
```

Save the file and run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to download and install the package.

## Using SkiaShadersMask

Now that we have the `flutter_skia` package installed, let's dive into using the `SkiaShadersMask` class to create our image panoramas.

First, import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'dart:ui' as ui;
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_skia/flutter_skia.dart';
```

Next, create a custom widget that extends the `CustomPaint` widget:

```dart
class ImagePanorama extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CustomPaint(
      painter: ImagePanoramaPainter(),
    );
  }
}
```

Inside the `ImagePanoramaPainter` class, override the `paint` method to manipulate and draw the image on the canvas:

```dart
class ImagePanoramaPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) async {
    final ui.Image image = await loadImage(); // Load your image here
    final paint = Paint(); // Create a paint object for drawing

    // Create a shader mask with the image
    final shaderMask = SkiaShadersMask(image);

    // Set the size of the mask
    shaderMask.size = Size(image.width.toDouble(), image.height.toDouble());

    // Set the position and scale of the mask
    shaderMask.position = Offset(0, 0);
    shaderMask.scale = 1;

    // Set the blend mode of the shader mask
    shaderMask.blendMode = BlendMode.srcOver;

    // Draw the shader mask on the canvas
    shaderMask.paint(canvas, paint);
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

In the `paint` method, we first load the image using the `loadImage` method. You can replace this with your own logic to load the desired image.

Next, we create a `Paint` object for drawing and instantiate a `SkiaShadersMask` object with the loaded image. We set the size, position, scale, and blend mode properties of the shader mask according to our requirements.

Finally, we call the `paint` method of the shader mask to draw it on the canvas.

## Using the ImagePanorama widget

To use the `ImagePanorama` widget in your Flutter app, simply add it to your widget tree. Here's an example:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Image Panorama'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ImagePanorama(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to use the `SkiaShadersMask` class from the `flutter_skia` package to create image panoramas in Flutter. By leveraging the power of the Skia library, we were able to manipulate and draw images on a canvas.

Experiment with different images, sizes, and configurations to create unique and visually appealing image panoramas in your Flutter applications.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
