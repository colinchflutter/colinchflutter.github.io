Image stitching is a technique used to combine multiple images into a single seamless panoramic image. Flutter, a popular cross-platform mobile app development framework, provides several libraries and tools to achieve this. One such tool is SkiaShadersMask, which is part of the Skia Graphics Library.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use the SkiaShadersMask library in Flutter to create image stitching effects in your applications.

## What is SkiaShadersMask?

SkiaShadersMask is a powerful library in Flutter that provides various shaders and effects for manipulating and blending images. It allows you to create custom effects, such as image stitching, by applying shaders to your images.

To get started, you need to add the SkiaShadersMask dependency to your Flutter project. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file of your project and include the following line in the dependencies section:

```yaml
dependencies:
  skia_shaders_mask: ^1.0.0
```

Next, run the `flutter pub get` command in your terminal or click on the "Pub get" button in your IDE to download and install the dependency.

## Stitching Images with SkiaShadersMask

Now that we have the SkiaShadersMask library added to our project, let's see how to use it to create image stitching effects.

First, import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:skia_shaders_mask/skia_shaders_mask.dart';
```

Next, create a `CustomPainter` for drawing and manipulating the images:

```dart
class StitchedImagePainter extends CustomPainter {
  final List<ImageProvider> images;

  StitchedImagePainter(this.images);

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final rect = Offset.zero & size;

    // Create a mask shader for blending the images
    final maskShader = SkiaShaderMask.createMaskShader(images);

    if (maskShader != null) {
      // Paint the masked images on the canvas
      canvas.saveLayer(rect, Paint());
      canvas.drawRect(rect, Paint()..shader = maskShader);
      canvas.restore();
    }
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return true;
  }
}
```

In the `StitchedImagePainter` class, we define a list of `ImageProvider` objects, which represent the images to be stitched. The `paint` method creates a mask shader using `SkiaShaderMask.createMaskShader` and applies it to the canvas using the `drawRect` method.

Finally, use the `CustomPaint` widget in your Flutter app to display the stitched image:

```dart
class StitchedImageApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<ImageProvider> images = [
    AssetImage('assets/image1.jpg'),
    AssetImage('assets/image2.jpg'),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Stitched Image'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomPaint(
            painter: StitchedImagePainter(images),
            child: Container(
              width: 300,
              height: 200,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the `StitchedImageApp` class, we create a list of `ImageProvider` objects representing the images to be stitched. We pass this list to the `StitchedImagePainter` in the `CustomPaint` widget.

That's it! Run your Flutter app, and you will see the stitched image displayed on the screen.

## Conclusion

SkiaShadersMask is a powerful library in Flutter for creating image stitching effects. By using the `SkiaShaderMask.createMaskShader` method, you can blend multiple images together and create stunning panoramic images in your Flutter applications.

Remember to import the necessary packages and follow the steps mentioned in this blog post to get started with SkiaShadersMask and create your own image stitching effects.

Start experimenting with different images and explore the many possibilities that SkiaShadersMask offers. Happy coding!
