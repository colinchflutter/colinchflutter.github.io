Skia is a powerful 2D graphics library that provides a wide range of tools and features for creating rich and dynamic visual experiences. One of the powerful features of Skia is the ability to create custom masks using the SkiaShaderMask class. In this blog post, we will explore how to create custom masks using SkiaShadersMask.

## What is SkiaShadersMask

SkiaShadersMask is a subclass of SkShader that allows you to create a custom mask for rendering graphics. It works by using a designated shader to determine the alpha values of the pixels in a given area. The alpha values are then used to determine the transparency of the pixels, allowing you to create intricate and complex shapes and patterns as masks.

## Creating a custom mask

To create a custom mask using SkiaShadersMask, you first need to define a custom shader. A shader in Skia is a class that determines the color or pattern of a pixel. There are different types of shaders available in Skia, such as linear gradient, radial gradient, bitmap, etc.

Let's start by creating a linear gradient shader that we will use as our custom mask:

```dart
final linearGradient = SkShader.linearGradient(
  [Offset(0, 0), Offset(100, 100)],
  [Colors.red, Colors.blue],
  TileMode.clamp,
);
```

In the above code, we create a linear gradient that starts from the top left corner of the canvas and goes to the bottom right corner. The gradient changes from red to blue. You can customize the gradient by specifying different colors and positions.

Once we have our custom shader, we can create the SkiaShadersMask instance:

```dart
final mask = SkShaderMask(
  shader: linearGradient,
);
```

## Applying the mask

Now that we have our custom mask, we can apply it to our graphics. Skia provides various rendering methods that allow you to apply the mask, such as `painter.drawImageRect`, `painter.drawRect`, etc.

Here's an example of applying the mask using `painter.drawImageRect`:

```dart
final image = await loadImageFromNetwork('https://example.com/image.png');
final imageSize = image.size;

final paint = Paint()..isAntiAlias = true;
final destinationRect = Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, imageSize.width, imageSize.height);

painter.drawImageRect(
  image,
  destinationRect,
  paint..shader = mask,
);
```

In the above code, we first load an image from a network source. Then we create a `Paint` instance with anti-aliasing enabled, and define the destination rectangle for our image. Finally, we use `painter.drawImageRect` to draw the image, applying the custom mask using the `paint..shader` attribute.

## Conclusion

SkiaShadersMask provides a flexible and powerful way to create custom masks for graphics using Skia. By defining custom shaders, you can create intricate and complex shapes and patterns as masks. Whether you want to add visual effects or create unique visual elements, SkiaShadersMask opens up a world of possibilities. Start experimenting with SkiaShadersMask in your next project and unlock the full potential of Skia!
