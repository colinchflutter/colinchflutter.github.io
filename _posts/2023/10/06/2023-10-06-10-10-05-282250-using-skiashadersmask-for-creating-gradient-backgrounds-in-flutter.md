## 1. What is SkiaShadersMask?

SkiaShadersMask is a Flutter package that provides a collection of shader masks based on Skia's shader system. It allows you to create complex gradient background effects by combining multiple shaders in various ways. With SkiaShadersMask, you can create gradients, textures, patterns, and more, to enhance the visual appeal of your Flutter applications.

## 2. Getting Started

### Installing SkiaShadersMask

To install the SkiaShadersMask package, add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  skia_shaders_mask: ^1.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

### Importing the Package

Next, import the SkiaShadersMask package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:skia_shaders_mask/skia_shaders_mask.dart';
```

## 3. Creating Gradient Backgrounds

To create a gradient background, you can use the `GradientMask` widget provided by the SkiaShadersMask package. The `GradientMask` widget applies a gradient shader to the child widget, enabling you to achieve various gradient effects.

Here's an example of creating a linear gradient background using `GradientMask`:

```dart
GradientMask(
  child: Container(
    // Your content here
  ),
  shader: LinearGradientShader(
    begin: Alignment.topCenter,
    end: Alignment.bottomCenter,
    colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.green],
  ),
)
```

In the above example, we define a linear gradient shader that starts from the top center and ends at the bottom center. The colors specified in the `colors` parameter define the gradient colors.

## 4. Customizing Gradient Effects

SkiaShadersMask provides several shader types that you can use to customize your gradient effects:

- `LinearGradientShader`: Creates a linear gradient shader.
- `RadialGradientShader`: Creates a radial gradient shader.
- `SweepGradientShader`: Creates a sweep (circular) gradient shader.

Each shader type provides different customization options, such as specifying the gradient direction, center, radius, and more. You can experiment with different parameters and values to create the desired gradient effect.

## 5. Conclusion

SkiaShadersMask is a powerful package that allows you to create stunning gradient backgrounds in your Flutter applications. By leveraging Skia's shader system, you can achieve various gradient effects with ease. Experiment with different configurations and customize your gradients to add visual appeal and depth to your Flutter UIs.

Remember to import the package, use the `GradientMask` widget, and explore the various shader types to create unique gradient effects. Enjoy creating beautiful gradient backgrounds in your Flutter projects!
