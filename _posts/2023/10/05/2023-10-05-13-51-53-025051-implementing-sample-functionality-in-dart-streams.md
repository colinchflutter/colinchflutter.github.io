Dart provides a powerful and convenient way to handle asynchronous programming through *streams*. Stream-based programming allows us to handle data events and perform operations on it as they occur. One common requirement is to sample data from a stream at regular intervals. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement sample functionality in Dart streams.

## Understanding Streams

In Dart, a *stream* is a sequence of asynchronous events. It is an abstract interface that provides methods for subscribing to events and consuming data as it becomes available. Streams can be created from various sources, including user input, network requests, or even other streams.

Streams in Dart follow the *Observable* design pattern, where they emit events whenever there is new data available. We can listen to these events by subscribing to the stream using the `listen` method.

## Sampling a Stream

Sampling a stream means extracting a subset of data events at regular intervals. For example, if we have a stream that emits temperature readings every second, we might want to sample the data every 5 seconds and perform some operation on it.

To implement sample functionality in Dart streams, we can take advantage of the `Stream.periodic` constructor. This constructor creates a stream that emits events at regular intervals. We can then combine this periodic stream with our source stream using the `zip` method from the `rxdart` package.

The `zip` method takes two streams as input and emits events when both streams have emitted a value. By combining the periodic stream with our source stream, we can sample the data at regular intervals.

## Example Implementation

Here's an example implementation of sampling functionality in Dart streams:

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:rxdart/rxdart.dart';

void main() {
  final sourceStream = Stream.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (value) => value);
  final sampleStream = Stream.periodic(Duration(seconds: 5), (value) => value)
      .zip(sourceStream, (a, b) => b);

  sampleStream.listen((data) => print('Sampled data: $data'));
}
```

In this example, we create a `sourceStream` that emits integers every second using the `Stream.periodic` constructor. We also create a `sampleStream` that emits integers every 5 seconds by zipping the periodic stream with the source stream. The resulting stream emits the same values as the source stream at regular intervals.

Finally, we subscribe to the `sampleStream` using the `listen` method and print the sampled data.

## Conclusion

Implementing sample functionality in Dart streams is a powerful technique that allows us to extract and process data at regular intervals. By utilizing the `Stream.periodic` constructor and combining it with our source stream, we can easily achieve this functionality.

The example above provides a basic implementation, but keep in mind that you can adapt it to your specific use cases and modify the sampling intervals as needed.
