## Introduction
In Flutter, streams are a powerful tool for managing and processing asynchronous data. RxDart is a reactive programming package that builds on top of Dart streams, providing additional capabilities for working with streams in a reactive manner. 

One common use case is combining multiple streams together to create a single stream that emits values from all the input streams. In this blog post, we will explore how to combine streams using RxDart in Flutter.

## Installing RxDart
To get started, we need to add the RxDart package to our Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  rxdart: ^0.27.2
```

Save the file and run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

## Combining Streams
RxDart provides several methods for combining streams, such as `combineLatest`, `zip`, `merge`, and `concat`. Let's take a look at each of these methods and see how they can be used.

### `combineLatest`
The `combineLatest` method takes a list of input streams and combines them into a single stream. When any of the input streams emit a new value, the combined stream emits a new value that consists of the latest values from all the input streams.

Here's an example that combines two streams:

```dart
import 'package:rxdart/rxdart.dart';

void main() {
  final stream1 = Stream.fromIterable([1, 2, 3]);
  final stream2 = Stream.fromIterable([4, 5, 6]);

  final combinedStream = Rx.combineLatest2(stream1, stream2, (a, b) => a + b);
  
  combinedStream.listen((value) => print(value)); // Output: 5, 7, 9
}
```

In this example, the combined stream emits the sum of the latest values from `stream1` and `stream2`.

### `zip`
The `zip` method combines multiple streams by emitting a new value only when all the input streams have emitted a value. The emitted value is a list containing one value from each input stream, in the order they were passed to the `zip` method.

Here's an example that zips two streams:

```dart
import 'package:rxdart/rxdart.dart';

void main() {
  final stream1 = Stream.fromIterable([1, 2, 3]);
  final stream2 = Stream.fromIterable([4, 5, 6]);

  final zippedStream = Rx.zip2(stream1, stream2, (a, b) => [a, b]);
  
  zippedStream.listen((value) => print(value)); // Output: [1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]
}
```

In this example, the zipped stream emits a list containing one value from `stream1` and `stream2` at a time.

### `merge`
The `merge` method combines multiple streams by merging their values into a single stream. The emitted values are in the order they were emitted by the input streams.

Here's an example that merges two streams:

```dart
import 'package:rxdart/rxdart.dart';

void main() {
  final stream1 = Stream.fromIterable([1, 2, 3]);
  final stream2 = Stream.fromIterable([4, 5, 6]);

  final mergedStream = Rx.merge([stream1, stream2]);
  
  mergedStream.listen((value) => print(value)); // Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
}
```

In this example, the merged stream emits the values from both `stream1` and `stream2` in the order they are emitted.

### `concat`
The `concat` method combines multiple streams by concatenating their values in the order they are provided. Each input stream emits all its values before the next input stream starts emitting its values.

Here's an example that concatenates two streams:

```dart
import 'package:rxdart/rxdart.dart';

void main() {
  final stream1 = Stream.fromIterable([1, 2, 3]);
  final stream2 = Stream.fromIterable([4, 5, 6]);

  final concatenatedStream = Rx.concat([stream1, stream2]);
  
  concatenatedStream.listen((value) => print(value)); // Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
}
```

In this example, the concatenated stream emits the values from `stream1` first, followed by the values from `stream2`.

## Conclusion
Combining streams is a powerful technique for manipulating asynchronous data in Flutter. With the help of RxDart, we can easily combine, zip, merge, or concatenate streams, enabling us to create more complex and reactive data processing pipelines. Experiment with these methods in your Flutter projects and unleash the full potential of reactive programming with RxDart.
