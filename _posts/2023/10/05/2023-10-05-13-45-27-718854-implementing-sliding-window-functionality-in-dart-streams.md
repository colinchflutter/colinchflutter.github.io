Streams are an important concept in Dart programming, allowing us to handle and process asynchronous data in a more efficient and elegant manner. One common use case is implementing sliding windows, where we process a sequence of data elements over a fixed window size.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement sliding window functionality in Dart streams. We will use the `rxdart` package, which provides additional utilities and operators for working with streams.

## Installing the rxdart package

To get started, we need to install the `rxdart` package. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```dart
pubspec.yaml
```
```shell
$ flutter packages get
```

This will add `rxdart` as a dependency in your project.

## Sliding window implementation

Now, let's dive into the implementation of the sliding window functionality. We will create a class called `SlidingWindow` that extends the `Subject` class from the `rxdart` package. This class will wrap an underlying stream and provide the sliding window functionality on top of it.

Here's the code for our `SlidingWindow` class:

```dart
import 'package:rxdart/rxdart.dart';

class SlidingWindow<T> extends Subject<T> {
  final Stream<T> source;
  final int windowSize;

  SlidingWindow(this.source, this.windowSize) {
    source.listen((event) => add(event));
  }

  @override
  Stream<T> get stream => super.stream.distinct();

  @override
  void onData(T event) {
    buffer.add(event);

    if (buffer.length > windowSize) {
      buffer.removeAt(0);
    }

    add(buffer.toList());
  }
}
```

In the `SlidingWindow` class, we have an `onData` method that gets called whenever there is new data coming from the underlying source stream. This method buffers the incoming events and emits a sliding window of events with the specified window size.

## Using the sliding window

Now that we have our `SlidingWindow` class implemented, let's see how we can use it with a sample stream. Here's an example:

```dart
import 'package:rxdart/rxdart.dart';

void main() {
  final source = Stream.fromIterable([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
  final slidingWindow = SlidingWindow<int>(source, 3);

  slidingWindow.stream.listen((data) => print(data));
}
```

In this example, we create a sample source stream with integers from 1 to 10. We then create an instance of the `SlidingWindow` class with a window size of 3. Finally, we subscribe to the resulting stream and print the sliding windows as they are emitted.

The output of this example would be:

```
[1]
[1, 2]
[1, 2, 3]
[2, 3, 4]
[3, 4, 5]
[4, 5, 6]
[5, 6, 7]
[6, 7, 8]
[7, 8, 9]
[8, 9, 10]
```

As you can see, the sliding window moves over the source stream, emitting windows of size 3.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to implement sliding window functionality in Dart streams using the `rxdart` package. We have created a `SlidingWindow` class that provides the sliding window functionality on top of an underlying stream. We have also seen how to use the sliding window class with a sample stream.

Sliding windows are a powerful tool when processing sequential data, and Dart streams make it easy to implement and work with them. By leveraging the `rxdart` package, we can enhance our streams with additional operators and utilities.
