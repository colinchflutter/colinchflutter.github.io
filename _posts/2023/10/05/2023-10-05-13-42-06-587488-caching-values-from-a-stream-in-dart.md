When working with streams in Dart, it is common to encounter scenarios where you need to cache values emitted from a stream. Caching can be useful when you want to re-use previously emitted values without re-fetching them from the source. In this blog post, we will explore different techniques to cache values from a stream in Dart.

## Using a List

The simplest way to cache the values from a stream is by using a `List` to store the emitted values. You can listen to the stream and add each emitted value to the list. Here's an example:

```dart
List<T> cache = [];

stream.listen((value) {
  cache.add(value);
});

// Access the cached values
print(cache);
```

By using this approach, you have all the emitted values stored in the `cache` list. You can access them later as needed. However, it's important to note that this approach consumes memory since all the emitted values are stored in memory.

## Using RxDart

[RxDart](https://pub.dev/packages/rxdart) is a reactive programming library for Dart that provides powerful stream manipulation and caching capabilities. It is built on top of Dart's Streams and features additional operators and methods.

One way to cache values using RxDart is by using the `ReplaySubject` class. The `ReplaySubject` buffers all emitted values and allows new subscribers to receive the buffered events. Here's an example:

```dart
import 'package:rxdart/rxdart.dart';

ReplaySubject<T> subject = ReplaySubject<T>();

// Listen to the stream and add values to the subject
stream.listen(subject.add);

// Access the cached values
subject.listen((value) {
  print(value);
});
```

In this example, the `subject` is the cache that holds all the emitted values. It acts as both a `Stream` and a `Sink`, allowing you to both add new values and listen to the cached values.

Another approach in RxDart is to use the `shareReplay` operator. This operator caches the previous emitted values and replays them for new subscribers. Here's an example:

```dart
import 'package:rxdart/rxdart.dart';

// Cache the previous 2 values
Stream<T> cachedStream = stream.shareReplay(maxSize: 2);

// Access the cached values
cachedStream.listen((value) {
  print(value);
});
```

In this example, the `shareReplay` operator ensures that the last two emitted values are cached and replayed for new subscribers. You can control the size of the cache by providing the `maxSize` parameter.

## Conclusion

Caching values from a stream can be a useful technique to improve performance and reduce unnecessary network requests or computations. In this blog post, we explored two different techniques to cache values in Dart - using a `List` and leveraging the powerful features of RxDart. Depending on your use case, you can choose the approach that best suits your needs.

Give these techniques a try and see how they can help you optimize your stream-based applications in Dart!
