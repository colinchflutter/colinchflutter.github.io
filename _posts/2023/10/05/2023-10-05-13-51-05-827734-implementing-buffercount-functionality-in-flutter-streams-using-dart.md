In Flutter, streams are used to handle asynchronous events and data streams. Streams in Dart come with various built-in functions to manipulate and transform the data emitted by the stream. One such function is `bufferCount`, which allows us to collect a specific number of events from a stream and emit them as a list.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement the `bufferCount` functionality in Flutter streams using Dart.

## What is bufferCount?

The `bufferCount` function collects a specified number of events from a stream and returns it as a `List`. For example, if we have a stream of numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10` and we use `bufferCount(3)`, it will emit three lists: `[1, 2, 3]`, `[4, 5, 6]`, and `[7, 8, 9]`.

## Implementing bufferCount in Flutter

To implement the bufferCount functionality in Flutter streams, we need to create a custom stream transformer. A stream transformer is an object that takes a stream as input and produces a new transformed stream as output.

Let's create a `bufferCount` transformer class:

```dart
import 'dart:async';

class BufferCountTransformer<T> extends StreamTransformerBase<T, List<T>> {
  final int count;

  BufferCountTransformer(this.count);

  @override
  Stream<List<T>> bind(Stream<T> stream) {
    return StreamTransformer<T, List<T>>.fromHandlers(
      handleData: (event, sink) {
        var buffer = <T>[];
        buffer.add(event);
        if (buffer.length == count) {
          sink.add(buffer);
          buffer = <T>[];
        }
      },
      handleDone: (sink) {
        if (buffer.isNotEmpty) {
          sink.add(buffer);
        }
        sink.close();
      },
    ).bind(stream);
  }
}
```

In the above code, we define a `BufferCountTransformer` class that extends the `StreamTransformerBase`. We pass the desired `count` of events to the constructor of the transformer.

Inside the `bind` method, we utilize the `StreamTransformer.fromHandlers` to handle the data and done events of the stream. We maintain a buffer list that collects events until it reaches the desired `count`, at which point we emit the buffer as a list and reset the buffer.

## Using bufferCount in Flutter Streams

Now that we have implemented the `bufferCount` functionality, let's see how we can use it in Flutter:

```dart
import 'dart:async';

void main() {
  final numbersStream = Stream<int>.fromIterable([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);

  numbersStream.transform(BufferCountTransformer<int>(3)).listen((bufferedList) {
    print(bufferedList);
  });
}
```

In the above code, we create a stream of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` using `Stream.fromIterable`. We then transform the stream using our `BufferCountTransformer` by passing the desired `count` as `3`.

Finally, we listen to the transformed stream and print each emitted buffered list.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to implement the `bufferCount` functionality in Flutter streams using Dart. By creating a custom stream transformer and utilizing the `StreamTransformer.fromHandlers`, we can easily collect a specific number of events from a stream and emit them as a list.

Implementing such functionality allows us to perform advanced data processing and manipulation on streams in Flutter applications.
