In Dart, `Stream` is a powerful tool for handling asynchronous events. It allows you to process data as it becomes available, providing a flexible way to work with streams of data. One common requirement when working with streams is to divide the data into fixed-sized windows and perform operations on each window. In this article, we will explore how to implement window functionality in Dart streams.

## Creating a Windowed Stream

To implement window functionality, we can define a custom stream transformer that takes a stream as input and outputs a windowed stream. We will use the `StreamTransformer` class from the `dart:async` package to achieve this.

Let's start by creating a function `windowTransformer` that takes an integer `windowSize` as a parameter. This function will return a `StreamTransformer` that transforms a stream into a windowed stream. Here's an example implementation:

```dart
import 'dart:async';

StreamTransformer<T, List<T>> windowTransformer<T>(int windowSize) =>
    StreamTransformer<T, List<T>>.fromHandlers(
      handleData: (data, EventSink<List<T>> sink) {
        if (sink is! EventSink<List<T>>) return;
        
        if (sink is! _WindowedSink<T>) {
          sink.add([data]);
          return;
        }
        
        sink.add(sink._addData(data));
      },
      handleDone: (sink) {
        if (sink is _WindowedSink<T>) sink._onDone();
      },
    );
```

In this code, we define a `windowTransformer` function that returns a `StreamTransformer`. Inside the `StreamTransformer`, we handle data events and the stream completion event.

The input event handler function checks the type of the sink to determine if it is a `_WindowedSink`. If it is not, we simply add the data to a new window (i.e., a list with a single element) and emit it through the sink. Otherwise, we add the data to the existing window through the `_addData` method of `_WindowedSink` and emit the updated window.

We also handle the completion event by calling `_onDone` if the sink is a `_WindowedSink`. We will define the `_WindowedSink` class shortly.

## Implementing the _WindowedSink Class

Now let's implement the `_WindowedSink` class, which will hold the windowed stream logic. The `_WindowedSink` class will extend `EventSink` and store the current window, window size, and a `EventSink<List<T>>` to emit windowed data.

Here's the implementation of the `_WindowedSink` class:

```dart
import 'dart:async';

class _WindowedSink<T> implements EventSink<List<T>> {
  final int _windowSize;
  EventSink<List<T>> _outputSink;
  List<T> _window;
  
  _WindowedSink(this._outputSink, this._windowSize) {
    _window = [];
  }
  
  @override
  void add(List<T> data) {
    for (var item in data) {
      _window.add(item);
      
      if (_window.length >= _windowSize) {
        _outputSink.add(List<T>.from(_window));
        _window.clear();
      }
    }
  }
  
  @override
  void addError(Object error, [StackTrace? stackTrace]) {
    _outputSink.addError(error, stackTrace);
  }
  
  @override
  void close() {
    if (_window.isNotEmpty) {
      _outputSink.add(List<T>.from(_window));
      _window.clear();
    }
    
    _outputSink.close();
  }
}
```

In this code, we define the `_WindowedSink` class that implements the `EventSink` interface. It accepts an `EventSink` in the constructor, which represents the output sink for the windowed data. It also stores the window size and the current window.

The `add` method is called when new data arrives. We iterate over the data items, adding them to the current window. If the window size becomes equal to or larger than the specified window size, we emit the windowed data through the output sink and clear the window.

The `addError` method simply forwards the error to the output sink, and the `close` method handles closing the sink by emitting the remaining window (if any) and then closing the output sink.

## Using the Windowed Stream Transformer

To use our windowed stream transformer, simply apply it to a stream and listen for the windowed data. Here's an example usage:

```dart
import 'dart:async';

void main() async {
  final stream = Stream.fromIterable([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]);
  final windowedStream = stream.transform(windowTransformer<int>(3));
  
  await for (var window in windowedStream) {
    print(window);
  }
}
```

In this code, we create a simple stream with the `Stream.fromIterable` constructor. We then apply our `windowTransformer` with a window size of 3 to the stream using the `transform` method. Finally, we use a `for` loop with an `await for` statement to listen for the windowed data and print each window.

The output of the above code will be:

```
[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8]
```

This demonstrates how we can implement window functionality in Dart streams using a custom stream transformer.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored how to implement window functionality in Dart streams using a custom stream transformer. We defined a `windowTransformer` function that returns a `StreamTransformer`, and we implemented a `_WindowedSink` class to handle the windowed stream logic. Finally, we used the windowed stream transformer to divide a stream into windows and perform operations on each window. Using this approach, you can process data in a more granular manner and handle complex event-based scenarios effectively.
