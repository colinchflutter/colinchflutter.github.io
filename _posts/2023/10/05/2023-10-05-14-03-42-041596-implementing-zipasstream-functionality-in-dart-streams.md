In Dart, streams provide a convenient way to work with asynchronous data. One common operation is to combine two or more streams into a single stream, known as zipping or merging. While Dart provides the `ZipStream` class to merge multiple streams, it returns a list of combined values at each event occurrence.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement a `zipAsStream` functionality that combines streams into a single stream, emitting the values as they arrive in the original order. This can be useful when working with real-time data synchronization or event handling in Dart.

## Understanding `zipAsStream`

The `zipAsStream` operation combines multiple streams into a single stream by emitting the values from all the streams in the order they arrive. It waits until all the input streams have emitted a value, then emits a list containing those values. This process continues for each new value emitted by any of the input streams.

For example, if we have two input streams containing the values `[1, 2, 3]` and `['A', 'B', 'C']`, the resulting stream will emit `[1, 'A']`, `[2, 'B']`, `[3, 'C']` when all the input streams have emitted their respective values.

## Implementing `zipAsStream`

To implement the `zipAsStream` functionality, we can leverage the power of Dart streams and the `StreamController` class. Here's an example implementation:

```dart
import 'dart:async';

Stream<List<T>> zipAsStream<T>(List<Stream<T>> streams) {
  final controller = StreamController<List<T>>();
  final values = List<T>(streams.length);
  var completedStreams = 0;

  void onValue(int index, T value) {
    values[index] = value;
    if (++completedStreams == streams.length) {
      controller.add(List<T>.from(values));
      completedStreams = 0;
    }
  }

  for (var i = 0; i < streams.length; i++) {
    streams[i].listen((value) => onValue(i, value),
        onDone: () {
          completedStreams++;
          if (completedStreams == streams.length) {
            controller.close();
          }
        });
  }
  return controller.stream;
}
```

In this implementation, we create a `StreamController` to manage the output stream. We also initialize an array `values` to store the latest value from each input stream. The `completedStreams` variable keeps track of how many input streams have completed.

The `onValue` function is called whenever a value is emitted from any of the input streams. It updates the `values` array with the latest value and checks if all the input streams have emitted a value. If so, it adds the current list of values to the output stream. The `onDone` callback is used to handle stream completion and close the `controller` when all input streams have completed.

## Example Usage

Let's see the `zipAsStream` function in action with a simple example:

```dart
void main() {
  final stream1 = Stream.fromIterable([1, 2, 3]);
  final stream2 = Stream.fromIterable(['A', 'B', 'C']);

  final zippedStream = zipAsStream<int>([stream1, stream2]);

  zippedStream.listen((values) {
    print(values);
  });
}
```

In this example, we create two input streams, `stream1` and `stream2`, containing `[1, 2, 3]` and `['A', 'B', 'C']`, respectively. We then pass these streams to the `zipAsStream` function, specifying the type `int` in this case. Finally, we listen to the resulting `zippedStream` and print each emitted value.

Running this code will generate the following output:

```
[1, A]
[2, B]
[3, C]
```

As you can see, the `zipAsStream` function successfully combines the values of two input streams into a single stream, preserving the order of arrival.

## Conclusion

Implementing the `zipAsStream` functionality allows us to merge multiple streams into a single stream in Dart. By leveraging the Dart stream and `StreamController` classes, we can efficiently combine values from multiple streams and handle stream completion. This functionality can be useful for real-time data synchronization, event handling, or any scenario where merging streams is required.

Try using the `zipAsStream` function in your Dart projects and see how it simplifies working with multiple streams. Happy coding!
