Dart is a powerful programming language that provides various features for working with streams. Streams are used to handle asynchronous data in Dart. In this article, we will explore how to implement distinct values in a stream using Dart.

## Introduction to Streams

Streams in Dart propagate events as data flows asynchronously. They are a way to handle continuous streams of data, such as network requests, user interactions, or data coming from a database. Dart provides a Stream class that represents a source of asynchronous events.

## Implementing Distinct Values

Sometimes, we need to ensure that a stream only emits distinct values, removing any duplicates that might occur. Dart provides a simple way to achieve this by using the `.distinct()` method provided by the `Stream` class.

The `.distinct()` method returns a new stream that only emits values that are distinct from the ones emitted previously. It keeps track of the emitted values and filters out any values that are duplicates.

## Example Code

Let's take a look at an example code snippet that demonstrates how to implement distinct values in a stream using Dart:

```dart
import 'dart:async';

void main() {
  final stream = Stream.fromIterable([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5]);

  final distinctStream = stream.distinct();

  distinctStream.listen((value) {
    print(value);
  });
}
```

In the above example, we create a `Stream` from an iterable that contains some duplicate values. We then apply the `.distinct()` method on the stream to create a new stream that only emits distinct values. Finally, we listen to the distinct stream and print each value as it is emitted.

When you run the above code, the output will be:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

As you can see, the duplicates `2` and `3` are removed, and only distinct values are emitted by the distinct stream.

## Conclusion

Implementing distinct values in a stream using Dart is straightforward with the help of the `.distinct()` method provided by the `Stream` class. It allows you to ensure that only unique values are emitted by the stream, removing any duplicates.

Streams are a powerful way to handle asynchronous data in Dart, and being able to remove duplicate values adds to their functionality. By leveraging the concepts discussed in this article, you can enhance your Dart applications that deal with continuous data streams.
