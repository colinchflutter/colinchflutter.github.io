Dart streams are a powerful feature that allows you to work with asynchronous data in a reactive way. In this article, we will explore how to implement the average functionality using Dart streams.

Imagine you have a stream of numbers and you want to calculate the average value. Here's how you can do it using Dart streams:

## Creating the stream

First, you need to create a stream of numbers. You can do this using the `Stream.fromIterable` constructor. Let's create a stream of numbers from 1 to 10:

```dart
import 'dart:async';

void main() {
  final stream = Stream.fromIterable([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
  // The rest of the code goes here
}
```

## Implementing the average functionality

To calculate the average of the numbers in the stream, you can use the `reduce` method of the stream. The `reduce` method takes a callback function that combines two elements of the stream into a single value. In this case, we'll use the callback function to calculate the sum of the numbers in the stream.

```dart
import 'dart:async';

void main() {
  final stream = Stream.fromIterable([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
  
  stream.reduce((value, element) => value + element).then((sum) {
    final average = sum / 10;
    print('The average is $average');
  });
}
```

In the code above, the `reduce` method combines each element of the stream with the previous result (initially set to the first element). It performs a summation operation by adding each element to the previous sum. Finally, the `then` method is called to handle the result of the summation and calculate the average.

## Conclusion

Using Dart streams, you can easily implement complex operations like calculating the average of a stream of numbers. The `reduce` method provides a convenient way to perform calculations on streams, making your code more expressive and readable.

By using Dart streams and the `reduce` method, you can leverage the power of reactive programming to handle asynchronous data in a concise and efficient way.
