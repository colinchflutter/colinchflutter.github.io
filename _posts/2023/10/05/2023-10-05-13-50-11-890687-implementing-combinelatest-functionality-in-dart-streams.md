In Dart, streams are a powerful tool for handling asynchronous events, allowing you to easily react to multiple asynchronous data sources. One common requirement when working with streams is to combine the latest values emitted by multiple streams. This can be done using the `combineLatest` functionality, which is not available out of the box in Dart streams. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement this functionality ourselves.

## Understanding `combineLatest`

The `combineLatest` operation takes two or more streams as input and returns a new stream that emits a combination of the latest values emitted by each input stream. Whenever any of the input streams emit a new value, the combined stream should emit a new value that contains the latest values from all the input streams.

Here is an example of how `combineLatest` could be used:

```dart
final stream1 = Stream<int>.fromIterable([1, 2, 3]);
final stream2 = Stream<int>.fromIterable([4, 5, 6]);

final combinedStream = combineLatest<int>([stream1, stream2]);

combinedStream.listen((combinedValue) {
  print(combinedValue);
});
```

In this example, the combined stream would emit the values `[3, 4]`, `[3, 5]`, and `[3, 6]` as each input stream emits a new value.

## Implementing `combineLatest`

To implement the `combineLatest` functionality, we can create a helper function that takes a list of streams as input and returns a new stream. Here's an implementation using Dart's StreamController:

```dart
import 'dart:async';

Stream<List<T>> combineLatest<T>(List<Stream<T>> streams) {
  final controller = StreamController<List<T>>();
  final latestValues = List<T>.filled(streams.length, null);

  for (var i = 0; i < streams.length; i++) {
    streams[i].listen((value) {
      latestValues[i] = value;
      controller.add(latestValues.toList());
    });
  }

  return controller.stream;
}
```

In this implementation, we create a StreamController to which we can listen and add new values. We also initialize a list, `latestValues`, with `null` values for each input stream. Whenever any of the input streams emit a new value, we update the corresponding value in `latestValues` and emit the updated list using the StreamController's `add` method.

## Conclusion

By implementing the `combineLatest` functionality in Dart streams, we can easily combine the latest values emitted by multiple streams. This can be useful in scenarios where we need to synchronize multiple asynchronous data sources. While this functionality is not available out of the box, we can create our own implementation using StreamController.
