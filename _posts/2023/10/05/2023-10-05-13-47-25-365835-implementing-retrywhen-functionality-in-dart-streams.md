In Dart, streams are a powerful way to handle asynchronous data. They allow us to react to events as they occur and process data in a sequential manner. However, there may be times when we want to add additional functionality to our streams, such as implementing retry logic for failed events.

Fortunately, Dart provides a convenient method called `retryWhen` that allows us to retry failed events in a stream based on certain conditions. This method is available on the `Stream` class and can be used to add retry functionality to our streams.

## Using the `retryWhen` method

The `retryWhen` method takes a `StreamTransformer` as its parameter. This transformer is responsible for processing the failed events and deciding whether to retry them or not. Let's take a look at an example to see how this works:

```dart
import 'dart:async';

void main() {
  // Create a stream that produces some events
  final stream = Stream<int>.fromIterable([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

  // Apply the retryWhen transformer to the stream
  final retryStream = stream.transform(_retryWhenTransformer());

  // Listen to the events in the retry stream
  retryStream.listen((event) {
    print(event);
  });
}

StreamTransformer<int, int> _retryWhenTransformer() {
  return StreamTransformer<int, int>((stream, cancelToken) {
    return stream.handleError((error) {
      // Retry the event only if it's an exception of type RetryableException
      if (error is RetryableException) {
        return stream.delay(Duration(seconds: 1));
      }

      // Propagate the error if it's not retryable
      throw error;
    });
  });
}

class RetryableException implements Exception {}
```

In this example, we create a stream of integers and apply the `_retryWhenTransformer` to it using the `transform` method. The transformer checks for any errors in the stream and retries the events only if the error is of type `RetryableException`. We simulate a retryable error by throwing an instance of `RetryableException` in the stream.

We use the `handleError` method to catch the errors in the stream and provide custom logic for retrying them. In this case, we delay the retry by one second using the `delay` method from the `Stream` class.

## Conclusion

Adding retry functionality to Dart streams can be useful in scenarios where we want to automatically retry failed events based on certain conditions. The `retryWhen` method provides a convenient way to implement this logic by allowing us to handle errors in the stream and decide whether to retry them or not. By using the `StreamTransformer` and `handleError` methods, we can customize the retry behavior according to our requirements.

By implementing the `retryWhen` functionality, we can make our Dart streams more robust and resilient to errors, ensuring a smoother data flow in our applications.

Remember to use the `retryWhen` method wisely and consider the impact on your application's performance and resource usage.
