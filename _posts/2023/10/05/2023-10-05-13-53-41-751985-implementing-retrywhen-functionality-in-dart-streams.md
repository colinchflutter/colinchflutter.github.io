Dart is a powerful programming language that allows you to create reactive applications using streams. Streams allow you to handle asynchronous data and events in a more controlled and efficient manner. One common requirement when working with streams is to implement retry functionality, where if a stream encounters an error, it is retried after a certain interval.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement the `retryWhen` functionality in Dart streams. `retryWhen` allows you to define a strategy for retrying a stream in case of errors, based on certain conditions.

### What is retryWhen?

`retryWhen` is a function that allows you to retry a stream based on certain conditions. It takes two parameters: `retryWhen` and `when`. The `retryWhen` parameter is a function that is called when an error occurs in the stream. It receives the error and can return either a new stream to retry or throw an error to terminate the stream. The `when` parameter is an optional function that takes the error as a parameter and determines whether to retry the stream or not.

### Implementing retryWhen

To implement `retryWhen` functionality in Dart streams, we can leverage the `StreamTransformer` class provided by the `async` package. First, let's take a look at the code snippet that demonstrates the implementation:

```dart
import 'dart:async';

StreamTransformer<T, T> retryWhen<T>(Stream retryStream(Error error)) {
  return StreamTransformer<T, T>((input, output) {
    final controller = StreamController<T>();

    void retry(error) {
      final retryController = StreamController<T>();

      void tryResubscribe() {
        input.listen(
          retryController.add,
          onError: (error) => retry(error),
          onDone: () => retryController.close(),
        );
      }

      retryStream(error)
          .listen(retryController.add, onError: (error) => retry(error), onDone: () => tryResubscribe());

      retryController.stream.listen(controller.add, onError: controller.addError, onDone: controller.close);
    }

    input.listen(controller.add, onError: retry, onDone: controller.close);

    return controller.stream.listen(output.add, onError: output.addError, onDone: output.close);
  });
}
```

Let's break down the code to understand how `retryWhen` works:

1. We define a generic function `retryWhen` that takes a `retryStream` function as a parameter. This function is responsible for creating a new stream that will be retried in case of an error.

2. `retryWhen` returns a `StreamTransformer` that transforms an input stream to an output stream.

3. Inside the `StreamTransformer`'s `bind` method, we create a new stream controller to handle the retry functionality. This controller is used to add data, errors, and close the stream.

4. We define a `retry` function that is called whenever an error occurs in the input stream. This function creates a new stream controller, which is used to subscribe to the retry stream. If the retry stream emits a value, it will be added to the retry controller, and if it emits an error, the `retry` function will be called again. If the retry stream completes, we call `tryResubscribe` to resubscribe to the input stream.

5. We subscribe to the input stream using the `listen` method, passing the `retry` function as the error callback.

6. Finally, we return the output stream using the `listen` method of the controller.stream, passing the `output` stream's add, addError, and close methods as callbacks.

### Using retryWhen

Once we have implemented the `retryWhen` functionality, we can use it in our streams. Here's an example usage:

```dart
final stream = Stream<int>.error('Error')
  .transform(retryWhen<int>((error) =>
    Stream.error(error).delay(Duration(seconds: 1))
  ));
```

In this example, we create a stream that throws an error using `Stream<int>.error('Error')`. We then use the `transform` method to apply the `retryWhen` function. The `retryStream` function inside `retryWhen` returns a new stream that throws an error after a delay of 1 second using `Stream.error(error).delay(Duration(seconds: 1))`.

The resulting `stream` will retry whenever an error occurs, based on the `retryStream` logic.

### Conclusion

Implementing retry functionality in Dart streams can be done using the `retryWhen` function. By defining a retry strategy for your streams, you can handle errors more gracefully and provide a better user experience. Remember to use this functionality judiciously and consider factors like retry limits and interval timings to optimize your application's behavior.

By utilizing the `retryWhen` functionality in your Dart streams, you can ensure that your asynchronous operations are more resilient and reliable. Happy coding!
