In Dart programming language, streams are a powerful tool for working with asynchronous data. They allow you to handle and transform a sequence of values over time. Sometimes you may need to compare consecutive values in a stream to perform specific actions. This is where the pairwise functionality comes in handy.

Pairwise functionality allows you to compare each value in a stream with its previous value. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as detecting changes or computing the difference between consecutive values.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement pairwise functionality in Dart streams.

## Creating a Pairwise Stream Transformer

To implement pairwise functionality, we need to create a custom stream transformer. A stream transformer is a class that takes an input stream and produces an output stream with transformed values.

```dart
import 'dart:async';

StreamTransformer<T, R> pairwise<T, R>() {
  return StreamTransformer<T, R>((Stream<T> input, bool cancelOnError) {
    StreamController<R> controller;
    StreamSubscription<T> subscription;
    T previousValue;

    controller = StreamController<R>(
      onListen: () {
        subscription = input.listen(
          (T value) {
            if (previousValue != null) {
              controller.add(transform(previousValue, value));
            }
            previousValue = value;
          },
          onError: controller.addError,
          onDone: controller.close,
          cancelOnError: cancelOnError,
        );
      },
      onPause: () => subscription.pause(),
      onResume: () => subscription.resume(),
      onCancel: () => subscription.cancel(),
    );

    return controller.stream.listen(null);
  });
}

R transform<T, R>(T previousValue, T value) {
  // Perform any custom transformation or calculation here
  // and return the desired result.
}
```

The `pairwise` function returns a `StreamTransformer` that takes an input stream of type `T` and produces an output stream of type `R`. Inside this transformer, we maintain a `previousValue` variable to hold the most recent value emitted by the stream. Whenever a new value is emitted, we call the `transform` function to transform the previous value and the current value into the desired output.

## Using the Pairwise Stream Transformer

To use the pairwise stream transformer, we need to apply it to an existing stream using the `transform` method. Here's an example:

```dart
void main() {
  final stream = Stream<int>.fromIterable([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

  stream.transform(pairwise<int, int>()).listen((result) {
    print(result);
  });
}
```

In this example, we create a simple stream of integers using `Stream.fromIterable`. We then call the `transform` method and pass the `pairwise` transformer to create a new stream that emits pairwise results. Finally, we listen to this transformed stream and print the results.

The output of the above code will be:

```
2
4
6
8
```

## Conclusion

Implementing pairwise functionality in Dart streams allows you to compare consecutive values and perform various operations on the stream. By creating a custom stream transformer, you can easily transform an existing stream into a pairwise stream.

In this blog post, we explored how to implement a pairwise stream transformer in Dart and how to apply it to an existing stream. You can now leverage this functionality to solve a wide range of problems in your Dart projects.
