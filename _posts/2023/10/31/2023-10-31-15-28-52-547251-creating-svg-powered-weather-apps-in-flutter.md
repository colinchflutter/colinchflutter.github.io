Weather apps are a popular choice for developers to explore different UI design techniques. One interesting approach is using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to create visually appealing weather icons in Flutter apps. In this tutorial, we will explore how to integrate SVG images and display them dynamically based on weather conditions.

## Introduction to SVG

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based markup language for describing two-dimensional vector graphics. Unlike raster images, SVGs can be scaled without loss of quality. This makes them ideal for creating weather icons that can adapt to different sizes and resolutions.

## Setting up the Flutter project

Start by creating a new Flutter project using the Flutter CLI or your preferred IDE. Then, add the `flutter_svg` package to your pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_svg: ^0.22.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package and its dependencies.

## Working with SVG package

To display SVG images in your Flutter app, you'll need to use the `SvgPicture` widget provided by the `flutter_svg` package. Here's an example of how to load and display an SVG image:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_svg/flutter_svg.dart';

SvgPicture.asset('assets/icons/sunny.svg')
```

Make sure to place your SVG files in the `assets` folder of your project. You can find free SVG weather icons from various sources, or create your own custom icons using editing software like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape.

## Fetching weather data

To create a dynamic weather app, you'll need to fetch weather data from a reliable API. There are several weather APIs available, such as OpenWeatherMap or Weatherbit. Select a suitable API and integrate it into your Flutter app using packages like `http` or `dio`.

## Displaying weather icons

Once you have the weather data, you can choose the appropriate SVG icon based on the weather conditions. For example, if the weather is sunny, you can display a sunny SVG icon. You can create a mapping between weather conditions and corresponding SVG icons. Here's an example of how to display weather icons dynamically based on weather conditions:

```dart
String weatherCondition = weatherData['condition']; // Assuming weatherData contains the fetched weather data

String iconAssetPath = '';

switch (weatherCondition) {
  case 'sunny':
    iconAssetPath = 'assets/icons/sunny.svg';
    break;
  case 'cloudy':
    iconAssetPath = 'assets/icons/cloudy.svg';
    break;
  // Add more cases for different weather conditions
}

SvgPicture.asset(iconAssetPath);
```

Remember to handle error cases gracefully and provide fallback icons or default images when necessary.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the power of SVGs, you can create visually appealing weather icons in your Flutter apps. Using the `flutter_svg` package, you can easily integrate SVG images and display them dynamically based on weather conditions. With weather data from a reliable API, you can create a fully functional weather app with beautiful SVG icons. So go ahead and give it a try!
