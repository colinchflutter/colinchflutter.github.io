Flutter is a powerful framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. It provides various widgets and functionalities to create stunning mobile user interfaces. While Flutter has built-in support for raster images like JPEG and PNG, it doesn't directly support SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) images out of the box. However, we can easily integrate external SVG libraries to render SVG images in Flutter. In this blog post, we will explore two popular libraries, `flutter_svg` and `svg` to handle SVG images in Flutter.

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

SVG is an XML-based markup language for describing two-dimensional vector graphics. Unlike raster images, SVG images can be scaled without any loss in quality. This makes them ideal for creating sharp and high-resolution graphics in mobile applications. By integrating external libraries, we can leverage the power of SVG images in our Flutter apps.

## Using flutter_svg <a name="using-flutter_svg"></a>

`flutter_svg` is a Flutter library that allows us to render SVG images. To use `flutter_svg`, we need to add it to our `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_svg: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, we can import `flutter_svg` and use the `SvgPicture` widget to display an SVG image. Here's an example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_svg/flutter_svg.dart';

SvgPicture.asset(
  'assets/images/my_image.svg',
  semanticsLabel: 'My SVG Image',
  width: 200,
  height: 200,
);
```

In the above code, we use the `SvgPicture.asset` constructor to load and render the SVG image from the given asset path. We can also specify optional parameters like `semanticsLabel`, `width`, and `height` to customize the rendering.

## Using svg <a name="using-svg"></a>

`svg` is another Flutter library that provides support for SVG images. To use `svg`, we need to add it to our `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  svg: ^0.7.0
```

After adding the dependency, we can import `svg` and use its classes and methods to render SVG images. Here's an example:

```dart
import 'package:svg/svg.dart';

Svg(
  '''<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
      <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
  </svg>''',
  size: Size(200, 200),
);
```

In the above code, we use the `Svg` widget and pass the SVG code as a string. We can define the SVG code inline, or load it from a file or network. We can also set the size of the rendered SVG image using the `size` parameter.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

Integrating external SVG libraries in Flutter allows us to leverage the power of SVG images in our mobile applications. Both `flutter_svg` and `svg` provide easy-to-use APIs to render SVG images in Flutter. Depending on the specific requirements of our project, we can choose the library that best suits our needs. So go ahead, explore SVG images, and create stunning graphics in your Flutter apps!
