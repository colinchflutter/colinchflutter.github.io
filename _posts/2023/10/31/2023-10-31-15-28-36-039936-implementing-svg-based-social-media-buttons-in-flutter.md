In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement SVG-based social media buttons in a Flutter application. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a widely used format for displaying vector-based images on the web. By using SVG icons for social media buttons, we can achieve a crisp and scalable design, even on different screen sizes.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have basic knowledge of Flutter and Dart programming languages. Make sure you have Flutter and Dart SDK installed on your machine.

## Setting up the Project

Start by creating a new Flutter project using the following command in your terminal:

```
flutter create flutter_social_media_buttons
cd flutter_social_media_buttons
```

## Installing Dependencies

We'll use the `flutter_svg` package to render SVG images in our Flutter application. Add the package as a dependency in the `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_svg: ^1.0.0
```

After updating the `pubspec.yaml` file, run the following command to fetch and install the package:

```
flutter pub get
```

## Adding SVG Images

Next, let's download the SVG icons for the social media buttons. You can search and download the icons from websites like [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) or [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).

Once you have the SVG icons downloaded, place them in the `assets` directory of your Flutter project. 

To reference the SVG images, update the `pubspec.yaml` file to include them as assets:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/
```

## Creating the Social Media Button Widget

Create a new Dart file called `social_media_button.dart`. This widget will handle rendering the SVG icons and triggering actions when the buttons are pressed.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_svg/flutter_svg.dart';

class SocialMediaButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final String iconPath;
  final Function onPressed;

  const SocialMediaButton({required this.iconPath, required this.onPressed});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return InkWell(
      onTap: onPressed,
      child: SvgPicture.asset(
        iconPath,
        width: 24,
        height: 24,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, we use the `SvgPicture.asset` widget provided by the `flutter_svg` package to load and display the SVG icon. The `InkWell` widget wraps the SVG icon and provides the onTap callback for handling button presses.

## Using the Social Media Button Widget

Now, let's integrate the `SocialMediaButton` widget into our Flutter application. Update the `lib/main.dart` file as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_social_media_buttons/social_media_button.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Social Media Buttons',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Social Media Buttons'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: SocialMediaButton(
            iconPath: 'assets/facebook.svg',
            onPressed: () {
              // Place your code here to handle the Facebook button press
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, we import the `SocialMediaButton` widget and use it inside the `Center` widget of the `Scaffold` body to display the Facebook button. You can replace `assets/facebook.svg` with the path of the SVG icon file for other social media buttons.

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```
flutter run
```

You should now see the social media button rendered on the screen. Test the button functionality by tapping on it.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to implement SVG-based social media buttons in a Flutter application. By utilizing the `flutter_svg` package and the `SvgPicture.asset` widget, we were able to display SVG icons and handle button press events.
