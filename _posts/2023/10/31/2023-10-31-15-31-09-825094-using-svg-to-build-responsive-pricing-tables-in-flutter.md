In this tutorial, we will explore how to use SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) to create responsive pricing tables in Flutter. Pricing tables are commonly used in websites and apps to showcase different subscription plans or pricing options. By utilizing SVG, we can easily create customizable and visually appealing pricing tables that adapt to different screen sizes.

## Introduction to SVG
SVG is a markup language for describing two-dimensional vector graphics. It provides a way to create resolution-independent graphics that can be easily scaled and resized without losing quality. In Flutter, we can use the flutter_svg package to load and render SVG files.

## Setting up the Project
To get started, create a new Flutter project using your preferred IDE or the command line. 

## Adding SVG Dependencies
Next, we need to add the flutter_svg package to our project's dependencies. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_svg: ^0.22.0
```

Save the file and run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

## Creating the Pricing Table Widget
Create a new Flutter widget named `PricingTable` that will serve as the container for our pricing cards. 

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class PricingTable extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      // Add your pricing cards here
    );
  }
}
```

## Designing the Pricing Cards
Inside the `PricingTable` widget, we will create multiple instances of a `PricingCard` widget. Each `PricingCard` will represent a pricing option with its respective details.

```dart
class PricingCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final String title;
  final String price;
  final List<String> features;

  const PricingCard({
    required this.title,
    required this.price,
    required this.features,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      // Design your pricing card using SVG and other widgets
    );
  }
}
```

Within the `PricingCard` widget, you can design the card's layout using SVG and other Flutter widgets like `Column`, `Row`, `Text`, and `Container`. You can load an SVG file using the `SvgPicture.asset` method provided by the `flutter_svg` package.

## Implementing Responsive Behavior
To make the pricing table responsive, we can use Flutter's `LayoutBuilder` widget. Wrap the `PricingTable` widget with the `LayoutBuilder` to get access to the available width of the screen.

```dart
class PricingTable extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LayoutBuilder(
      builder: (context, constraints) {
        return Container(
          // Use the constraints to adjust the pricing cards dynamically
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

Based on the available width, you can adjust the number of pricing cards displayed per row and customize their layout accordingly.

## Conclusion
By utilizing SVG and the capabilities of Flutter, we can easily create responsive pricing tables that adapt to different screen sizes. SVG graphics allow us to design visually appealing pricing cards that look great on any device. Experiment with different layouts, styles, and animations to create unique and user-friendly pricing tables in your Flutter applications.
