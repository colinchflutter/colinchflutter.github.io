## Introduction

Referral tracking allows you to understand the effectiveness of various marketing campaigns and channels. By tracking the referral source, you can personalize your app's user experience and tailor it to specific user segments. Firebase Analytics is a powerful tool for both tracking user behavior and attributing user acquisitions to specific sources. Flutter, on the other hand, is a popular framework for building cross-platform apps.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. A Flutter development environment set up on your machine.
2. A Firebase project with Firebase Analytics enabled.
3. The Flutter Firebase Analytics package added to your Flutter project.

## Setting up Firebase Analytics

To set up Firebase Analytics in your Flutter app, follow these steps:

1. Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console if you haven't already.

2. Add the Firebase configuration file to your Flutter project by following the Firebase official documentation.

3. Add the Firebase Analytics package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     firebase_analytics: ^8.1.1
   ```

4. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package dependencies.

5. Import the Firebase Analytics package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:firebase_analytics/firebase_analytics.dart';
   import 'package:firebase_analytics/observer.dart';
   ```

6. Initialize Firebase Analytics in your `main.dart` file:

   ```dart
   void main() {
     WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
     FirebaseAnalytics().logAppOpen();
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

## Implementing referral tracking

To implement referral tracking in your Flutter app, you can use the `FirebaseAnalytics` class provided by the Firebase Analytics package. Follow these steps:

1. Add the following code to track the referral source when the app is opened:

   ```dart
   FirebaseAnalytics().setAnalyticsCollectionEnabled(true);
   FirebaseAnalytics().logAppOpen();
   ```

   This will ensure that the app opens are tracked by Firebase Analytics.

2. Use the `FirebaseAnalytics` class to set the referral source when the app is opened through a referral link. This can be done by adding the following code:

   ```dart
   FirebaseAnalytics().setUserProperty(
     name: 'referral_source',
     value: 'referrer_code_here',
   );
   ```

   Replace `referrer_code_here` with the referral code or source identifier.

## Personalizing app based on referral source

With the referral source tracked, you can personalize your app's user experience based on the referral source. For example, you can show specific onboarding screens or offer special promotions for users coming from specific referral sources.

To personalize the app based on the referral source, you can retrieve the referral source from Firebase Analytics and use it in your app logic.

```dart
FirebaseAnalytics().getUserProperties().then((properties) {
  String referralSource = properties['referral_source'];
  // Use referralSource to personalize the app experience
});
```

## Conclusion

Implementing referral tracking personalization based on Firebase Analytics insights in a Flutter app can provide valuable insights into user acquisition and allow you to tailor the user experience to specific user segments. By tracking referral sources and personalizing the app, you can improve user engagement and conversion rates. Firebase Analytics and Flutter provide a powerful combination for implementing referral tracking in your app. Happy tracking!
