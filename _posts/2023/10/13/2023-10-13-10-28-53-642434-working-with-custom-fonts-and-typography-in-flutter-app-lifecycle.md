Typography plays a crucial role in enhancing the visual appeal and user experience of a mobile application. When building a Flutter app, you may want to add custom fonts to achieve a unique and personalized look. In this blog post, we will explore how to work with custom fonts and typography in the app lifecycle.

## Adding Custom Fonts
Flutter allows you to use custom font files in your application by importing them and declaring them in the `pubspec.yaml` file. 

To add a custom font:
1. Place the font file(s) in a folder within your project.
2. In the `pubspec.yaml` file, add an entry specifying the location of the font file(s) under the `fonts` section. For example:
```yaml
fonts:
  - family: OpenSans
    fonts:
      - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf
      - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Bold.ttf
        weight: 700  # specify the font weight
```
3. Save the `pubspec.yaml` file and run `flutter pub get` to download and include the fonts in your application.

Once the custom fonts are included, you can refer to them by their given family name in your code.

## Setting Up Typography
The Flutter framework provides the `Typography` class, which defines a set of text styles with various font families, sizes, weights, and other properties. By modifying the default typography, you can globally change the appearance of text in your app.

To set up typography:
1. Create a custom `Typography` instance by extending the `Typography` class.
2. Override the desired text styles, such as `bodyText1`, `headline6`, etc., with your desired fonts, sizes, and weights.
```dart
class MyTypography extends Typography {
  @override
  TextStyle get bodyText1 => TextStyle(
    fontFamily: 'OpenSans',
    fontSize: 16.0,
    color: Colors.black,
  );

  @override
  TextStyle get headline6 => TextStyle(
    fontFamily: 'OpenSans-Bold',
    fontSize: 20.0,
    fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
    color: Colors.blue,
  );
}
```
3. In the `MaterialApp` widget, pass an instance of your custom `Typography` class to the `theme` property.
```dart
MaterialApp(
  theme: ThemeData(
    typography: MyTypography(),
    // other theme settings
  ),
  // other app configurations
);
```

With the custom `Typography` class applied, the default text styles in your app will reflect the specified font families, sizes, and weights.

## Changing the Font at Runtime
Sometimes, you may want to provide users with the option to change the font style while the app is running. Flutter makes it easy to achieve this functionality by utilizing `Provider` or a similar state management solution.

To change the font at runtime:
1. Use a state management solution, such as `Provider`, to manage the font selection state.
2. Create a `FontManager` class that holds a list of available font families and the currently selected font family.
3. Wrap your `MaterialApp` with the state management provider and pass the `FontManager` instance as a value.
4. In your UI, display the available font options and allow the user to select their preferred font. When the font selection is changed, update the `FontManager` state accordingly.
5. Create a custom `TextStyle` or use the default `TextStyle` with the selected font family.
6. Apply the updated text style to your text widgets using the selected font family.

With this approach, users can dynamically switch between different font styles within your Flutter app.

## Conclusion
Custom fonts and typography are powerful tools for creating visually appealing and personalized mobile applications. By adding custom fonts, setting up typography, and allowing users to change fonts at runtime, you can achieve a unique and engaging user experience in your Flutter app.

Remember to import the necessary packages and refer to official Flutter documentation and resources for more detailed implementation guidelines. Happy coding! #flutter #typography
