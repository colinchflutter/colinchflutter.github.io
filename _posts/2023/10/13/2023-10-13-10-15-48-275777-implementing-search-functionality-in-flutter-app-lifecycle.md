## Introduction

Adding search functionality to an app is a common requirement. Usually, a search box is provided where users can enter keywords to search for specific content within the app. In this blog post, we will look at how to implement search functionality using Flutter's app lifecycle.

## Implementing Search Functionality

To implement search functionality, we need to capture user input and perform the search operation when requested. Flutter provides a widget called `TextField` to capture user input. We can use this widget to create a search bar.

```dart
TextField(
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Update search query state
  },
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    hintText: 'Search',
  ),
)
```

In the above code snippet, we are creating a `TextField` widget and providing an `onChanged` callback. This callback will be triggered whenever the user enters or changes the search query value. We can update the search query state within this callback.

## Handling Search Results

Once we have captured the search query, we need to perform the actual search operation and display the search results. This can be done by using a search algorithm or querying a database. For simplicity, let's assume we have a list of items and we want to filter the list based on the search query.

```dart
List<String> items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Durian'];
List<String> searchResults = [];

void performSearch(String query) {
  searchResults = items.where((item) => item.contains(query)).toList();
  // Update UI with search results
}
```

In the above code snippet, we have a list of items and a `performSearch` function that takes the search query as input. It filters the items based on whether they contain the search query and stores the filtered results in `searchResults` list. Finally, we can update the UI to display the search results.

## Conclusion

Implementing search functionality in a Flutter app can be achieved by capturing user input using a `TextField` widget and performing the search operation based on the captured query. By leveraging the app lifecycle, we can ensure that the search functionality works seamlessly throughout the app.

In this blog post, we explored how to implement search functionality using the app lifecycle in a Flutter app. Remember to handle edge cases, such as debouncing the search queries to avoid excessive API calls, and ensure a smooth user experience.
