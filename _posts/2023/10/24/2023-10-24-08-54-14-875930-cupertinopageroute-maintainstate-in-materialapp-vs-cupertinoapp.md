In Flutter, `CupertinoPageRoute` is used for navigation in iOS-style applications, while `MaterialPageRoute` is used for navigation in Material design-style applications. When using these navigation routes within `MaterialApp` and `CupertinoApp`, there is a difference in how the `maintainState` property behaves.

The `maintainState` property determines whether the previous widget's state is kept alive when navigating to a new page. Let's explore how it works in both `MaterialApp` and `CupertinoApp`:

### MaterialApp
When using `MaterialApp`, the `maintainState` property of `MaterialPageRoute` is set to `true` by default. This means that the state of the previous page's widgets is preserved when navigating to a new page. This behavior is useful when you want to maintain the state of certain widgets, such as form inputs or scroll positions, as users navigate through different pages in your app.

To override the default behavior and disable state maintenance, you can set the `maintainState` property to `false` when defining a `MaterialPageRoute`. For example:

```dart
MaterialPageRoute(
  maintainState: false,
  builder: (context) => MyNewPage(),
);
```

### CupertinoApp
In contrast, when using `CupertinoApp`, the `maintainState` property of `CupertinoPageRoute` is set to `false` by default. This means that the state of the previous page's widgets is not preserved when navigating to a new page. The reason behind this behavior is to align with the iOS navigation paradigm, where the user expects a fresh state when they navigate back to a previous screen.

If you want to maintain the state of the previous page's widgets when using `CupertinoApp`, you can set the `maintainState` property of `CupertinoPageRoute` explicitly to `true`. For example:

```dart
CupertinoPageRoute(
  maintainState: true,
  builder: (context) => MyNewPage(),
);
```

### Conclusion
The `maintainState` property in `MaterialApp` and `CupertinoApp` controls how the state of the previous page's widgets is handled when navigating to a new page. By default, `MaterialApp` maintains the state, while `CupertinoApp` does not. However, you can override this behavior by setting the `maintainState` property to your desired value in the respective `PageRoute`.

Remember to consider the design principles of the platform you are developing for when making decisions about state preservation in your Flutter app.
