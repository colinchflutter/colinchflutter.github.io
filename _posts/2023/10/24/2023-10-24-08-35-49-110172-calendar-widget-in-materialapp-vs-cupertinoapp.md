When developing a mobile application, you often need to include a calendar widget to display dates and allow users to interact with them. In Flutter, you have two main options for implementing a calendar widget: using the `MaterialApp` or the `CupertinoApp`.

## 1. MaterialApp

The `MaterialApp` is the default material design-themed app widget in Flutter. It provides a set of pre-designed UI components that follow the Material Design guidelines. 

To include a calendar widget in a `MaterialApp`, you can use the `flutter_calendar_carousel` package. This package provides a highly customizable calendar widget with various features like displaying events, selecting date ranges, and more.

To use `flutter_calendar_carousel` in your `MaterialApp` project, follow these steps:

1. Include the package in your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_calendar_carousel: ^x.x.x
```
(make sure to replace `x.x.x` with the latest version)

2. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_calendar_carousel/flutter_calendar_carousel.dart' show CalendarCarousel;
```

3. Use the `CalendarCarousel` widget in your `MaterialApp`:
```dart
class MyCalendarScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Calendar'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: CalendarCarousel(
          // Customize the calendar here
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## 2. CupertinoApp

The `CupertinoApp` is used to create iOS-styled applications in Flutter, following the Cupertino design guidelines.

When it comes to a calendar widget in a `CupertinoApp`, you can utilize the `table_calendar` package. This package provides a calendar widget that mimics the default iOS calendar app.

To incorporate the `table_calendar` package in your `CupertinoApp`, follow these steps:

1. Include the package in your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yaml
dependencies:
  table_calendar: ^x.x.x
```
(replace `x.x.x` with the latest version)

2. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:table_calendar/table_calendar.dart';
```

3. Use the `TableCalendar` widget in your `CupertinoApp`:
```dart
class MyCalendarScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CupertinoPageScaffold(
      navigationBar: CupertinoNavigationBar(
        middle: Text('Calendar'),
      ),
      child: SafeArea(
        child: TableCalendar(
          // Customize the calendar here
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

In summary, both `MaterialApp` and `CupertinoApp` offer distinct ways to include a calendar widget in a Flutter application. The choice between the two depends on the design theme you want to follow: Material Design for Android-like apps or Cupertino Design for iOS-like apps.
