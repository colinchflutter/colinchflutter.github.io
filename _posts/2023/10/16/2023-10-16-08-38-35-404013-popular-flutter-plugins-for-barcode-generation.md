```

After adding the dependency, you can use the plugin in your Flutter code to scan barcodes. Here's an example of how to use `flutter_barcode_scanner`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_barcode_scanner/flutter_barcode_scanner.dart';

String barcodeData = '';

Future<void> scanBarcode() async {
  try {
    String barcode = await FlutterBarcodeScanner.scanBarcode(
      '#ff6666', // Optional color for the toolbar background
      'Cancel',   // Optional text for the cancel button
    );

    setState(() {
      barcodeData = barcode;
    });
  } catch (e) {
    barcodeData = 'Error: $e';
  }
}

// Call the `scanBarcode` function to initiate barcode scanning
```

## flutter_barcode_generator

After adding the dependency, you can use the plugin in your Flutter code to generate barcodes. Here's an example of how to use `flutter_barcode_generator` to generate a QR code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_barcode_generator/flutter_barcode_generator.dart';

Image barcodeImage = Image.network('');

void generateQRCode(String data) {
  barcodeImage = BarcodeGenerator.generateBarcode(
    BarcodeType.QRCode,
    data,
    Color(0xFF000000), // Color of the barcode
    Color(0xFFFFFFFF), // Color of the background
  );
}

// Call the `generateQRCode` function with the desired data to generate a QR code
```
