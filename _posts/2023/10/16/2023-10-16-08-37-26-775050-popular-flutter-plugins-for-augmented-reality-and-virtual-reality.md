Flutter is a powerful framework that allows developers to create cross-platform applications easily. Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) have gained significant popularity in recent years, enabling users to immerse themselves in digital environments. If you are a Flutter developer looking to incorporate AR or VR features into your app, here are some popular plugins that can help you get started:

## 1. ARKit Flutter

**ARKit Flutter** is a plugin that provides support for building AR experiences on iOS devices using Apple's ARKit framework. With ARKit Flutter, developers can create interactive AR applications with features like plane detection, light estimation, object tracking, and more. It offers a simple yet powerful API that allows you to seamlessly integrate AR functionalities into your Flutter app.

**Example code:**

```dart
import 'package:arkit_plugin/arkit_plugin.dart';

ARKitSceneView arKitSceneView = ARKitSceneView();

Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ARKitSceneView(
    onARKitViewCreated: (ARKitController c) {
      arKitSceneView = c;
      arKitSceneView.add(ARKitNode(
        geometry: ARKitBox(),
      ));
    },
  );
}
```

## 2. Unity Flutter Widget

**Unity Flutter Widget** is a plugin that allows you to embed Unity scenes into your Flutter app. Unity is a popular game development platform that supports building immersive VR experiences. With this plugin, you can effortlessly combine the power of Unity's VR capabilities with Flutter's UI flexibility. It provides a seamless integration between Flutter and Unity, enabling you to create interactive VR content within your app.

**Example code:**

```dart
import 'package:unity_widget/unity_widget.dart';

UnityWidget unityWidget = UnityWidget();

Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return UnityWidget(
    onUnityViewCreated: (controller) {
      unityWidget = controller;
      unityWidget.postMessage("SpawnObject", "Cube");
    },
  );
}
```
