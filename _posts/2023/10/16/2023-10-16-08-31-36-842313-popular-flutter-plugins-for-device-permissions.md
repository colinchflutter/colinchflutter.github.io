## Permission Handler

[Permission Handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) is one of the most popular plugins for handling device permissions in Flutter. It provides a simple and unified API to request and check permissions on both Android and iOS devices.

To use the Permission Handler plugin, you need to add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  permission_handler: ^12.0.0
```

Once installed, you can use the Permission Handler API to request and check permissions. Here's an example of how to request camera permission:

```dart
import 'package:permission_handler/permission_handler.dart';

// ...

PermissionStatus status = await Permission.camera.request();

if (status.isGranted) {
  // Permission is granted
} else if (status.isDenied) {
  // Permission is denied
} else if (status.isPermanentlyDenied) {
  // Permission is permanently denied
}
```

Permission Handler provides various methods to request different permissions and also offers additional features like checking if a permission is blocked permanently.

## Permission Handler Plus

[Permission Handler Plus](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler_plus) is an extension of the Permission Handler plugin that aims to simplify the permission handling process even further. It provides a high-level, declarative API that makes it easier to handle permissions in Flutter.

To use Permission Handler Plus, add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  permission_handler_plus: ^2.0.0
```

Once installed, you can use the Permission Handler Plus API to request and check permissions. Here's an example of how to request camera permission:

```dart
import 'package:permission_handler_plus/permission_handler_plus.dart';

// ...

PermissionStatus status = await Permission.camera.request();

if (status.isGranted) {
  // Permission is granted
} else if (status.isDenied) {
  // Permission is denied
} else if (status.isPermanentlyDenied) {
  // Permission is permanently denied
}
```

Permission Handler Plus provides a simplified and more intuitive API compared to Permission Handler.

## Conclusion
