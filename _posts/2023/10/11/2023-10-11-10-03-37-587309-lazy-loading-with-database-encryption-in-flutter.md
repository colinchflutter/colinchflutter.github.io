In many mobile applications, it is common to store sensitive data in a local database. However, securing this data is of utmost importance to ensure that it is not accessible to unauthorized parties. One effective way to protect sensitive data is through encryption.

Flutter, being a versatile and powerful framework, provides native support for database operations through various packages. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement lazy loading with database encryption in Flutter using the `sqflite` package and the `flutter_secure_storage` package.

## Introduction to lazy loading

Lazy loading is a technique that loads data into memory only when it is requested, rather than loading all data at once. This approach can be particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, as it helps to minimize memory usage and improve performance.

## Encryption in Flutter

To ensure the security of sensitive data, encryption is an essential aspect to consider. Flutter provides the `flutter_secure_storage` package, which allows you to securely store and retrieve sensitive information. This package encrypts the data using the device-specific encryption services, ensuring that it is protected from unauthorized access.

## Implementing lazy loading with database encryption

1. Add the `sqflite` and `flutter_secure_storage` dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  sqflite: ^2.0.0
  flutter_secure_storage: ^4.2.0
```

2. Import the required packages in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';
import 'package:flutter_secure_storage/flutter_secure_storage.dart';
```

3. Initialize the `flutter_secure_storage` instance:

```dart
final FlutterSecureStorage _storage = FlutterSecureStorage();
```

4. Implement the lazy loading mechanism by fetching data from the encrypted database in batches. Here's an example of loading data in chunks of 100 items:

```dart
int batchSize = 100;
int offset = 0;

while (true) {
  List<Map<String, dynamic>> results = await _queryEncryptedData(batchSize, offset);
  
  if (results.isEmpty) {
    break;
  }
  
  // Process and use the data
  
  offset += batchSize;
}
```

5. Implement the `_queryEncryptedData` method to query the encrypted database using the `sqflite` package:

```dart
Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> _queryEncryptedData(int limit, int offset) async {
  final Database database = await openEncryptedDatabase();
  final List<Map<String, dynamic>> results = await database.rawQuery('''
    SELECT * FROM tableName LIMIT ? OFFSET ?
  ''', [limit, offset]);

  return results;
}
```

6. Implement the `openEncryptedDatabase` method to open the encrypted database:

```dart
Future<Database> openEncryptedDatabase() async {
  final String password = await _storage.read(key: 'encryptionPassword');
  final String path = 'path_to_encrypted_database';

  return await databaseFactory.openDatabase(
    path,
    password: password.isNotEmpty ? password : null,
  );
}
```

7. Make sure to securely store and retrieve the encryption password in the `flutter_secure_storage`:

```dart
String password = 'super_secure_password';
await _storage.write(key: 'encryptionPassword', value: password);
```

## Conclusion

By implementing lazy loading with database encryption in Flutter, you can ensure the security of sensitive data stored in your mobile applications. With the `sqflite` package and the `flutter_secure_storage` package, you have access to powerful tools to make your data storage secure and efficient.

Remember to handle encryption keys and passwords with care and ensure that your encryption implementation follows industry best practices.

Happy coding!
