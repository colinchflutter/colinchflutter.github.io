## Network Connectivity Management

### Flutter

In Flutter, we can use the `connectivity` package to check the network connectivity status. This package provides a platform-independent way to access the network connection status of the device. By using this package, we can determine whether the device is connected to a Wi-Fi network, cellular network, or has no network connection at all. Based on the connectivity status, we can show appropriate messages or take specific actions in our app.

To implement network connectivity management in Flutter, follow these steps:

1. Add the `connectivity` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     connectivity: ^2.0.2
   ```

2. Import the package in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:connectivity/connectivity.dart';
   ```

3. Check the connectivity status using the `Connectivity` instance:

   ```dart
   var connectivityResult = await (Connectivity().checkConnectivity());

   if (connectivityResult == ConnectivityResult.mobile || connectivityResult == ConnectivityResult.wifi) {
     // Device is connected to the internet
   } else {
     // Device is offline
   }
   ```

### React Native

In React Native, we can use the `@react-native-community/netinfo` package to check the network connectivity status. This package provides a simple API to determine the device's connection type and whether the device is online or offline. It works on both iOS and Android platforms.

To implement network connectivity management in React Native, follow these steps:

1. Install the `@react-native-community/netinfo` package:

   ```bash
   npm install @react-native-community/netinfo
   ```

2. Import the package in your JavaScript file:

   ```javascript
   import NetInfo from '@react-native-community/netinfo';
   ```

3. Subscribe to network connectivity changes and handle them:

   ```javascript
   const unsubscribe = NetInfo.addEventListener(state => {
     if (state.type === "wifi" || state.type === "cellular") {
       // Device is connected to the internet
     } else {
       // Device is offline
     }
   });

   // To stop listening to network changes
   unsubscribe();
   ```

## Offline Support

### Flutter

Flutter provides built-in support for caching HTTP requests, which allows us to implement offline functionality easily. By caching responses, we can serve them to the user even when they are offline.

To implement offline support in Flutter, follow these steps:

1. Add the `dio` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     dio: ^4.0.0
   ```

2. Import the package and create an instance of `Dio`:

   ```dart
   import 'package:dio/dio.dart';

   final dio = Dio();
   ```

3. Make HTTP requests using the `dio` instance:

   ```dart
   try {
     final response = await dio.get('https://api.example.com/data');

     // Cache the response
     dio.interceptors.add(DioCacheManager(CacheConfig()).interceptor);

     // Use the response data
     print(response.data);
   } catch (e) {
     // Handle when offline
   }
   ```

### React Native

In React Native, we can utilize the `AsyncStorage` API to store and retrieve data locally, enabling offline functionality.

To implement offline support in React Native, follow these steps:

1. Install the `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` package:

   ```bash
   npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
   ```

2. Import and use the `AsyncStorage` API in your JavaScript file:

   ```javascript
   import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

   // Save data locally
   await AsyncStorage.setItem('key', 'data');

   // Retrieve data locally
   const data = await AsyncStorage.getItem('key');
   ```

## Conclusion

Both Flutter and React Native provide solutions for managing network connectivity and implementing offline support in mobile apps. By utilizing the appropriate packages and APIs, we can create robust applications that gracefully handle different network scenarios.

In this blog post, we explored how to manage network connectivity using the `connectivity` package in Flutter and the `@react-native-community/netinfo` package in React Native. We also covered how to implement offline support by caching HTTP requests in Flutter and using `AsyncStorage` in React Native.

Implementing these features not only enhances the user experience but also enables users to access the app's content and functionality even when they are offline.
