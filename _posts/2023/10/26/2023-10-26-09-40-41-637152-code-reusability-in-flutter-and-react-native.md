When developing mobile applications, code reusability plays a crucial role in saving time and effort. It allows developers to write code that can be shared across different platforms, maximizing efficiency and minimizing duplication. Two popular frameworks that emphasize code reusability are Flutter and React Native.

## Flutter

Flutter is an open-source UI framework developed by Google, which enables developers to build native applications for Android, iOS, web, and desktop using a single codebase. Its core idea revolves around a reactive programming model, where the UI is built as a composition of widgets.

### Key features of code reusability in Flutter:

1. **Single codebase:** Flutter allows developers to write code once and run it on multiple platforms. This means that a Flutter application can have the same UI and functionality on both Android and iOS devices, reducing the need for platform-specific code.

2. **Widget-based architecture:** Flutter's UI is based on a rich set of widgets that can be composed and reused to build complex UI elements. Widgets are composable and can be nested within each other, allowing developers to reuse components throughout the application.

3. **Hot Reload:** One of the key features of Flutter is its Hot Reload functionality, which enables developers to see the changes they make in the code instantly reflected in the app. This feature greatly enhances the development process by allowing developers to iterate quickly and experiment with different UI components.

### Example code in Flutter:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final String text;
  final Function onPressed;

  MyButton({this.text, this.onPressed});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return RaisedButton(
      onPressed: onPressed,
      child: Text(text),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code snippet, a custom reusable button widget `MyButton` is created. This widget can be used across the application by passing different text and onPressed functions.

## React Native

React Native, developed by Facebook, is a widely-used framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to build native apps for both Android and iOS platforms using a single codebase.

### Key features of code reusability in React Native:

1. **Component-based architecture:** React Native follows a component-based architecture, where UI elements are created as reusable components. These components can be shared and reused across different screens and applications, reducing duplication of code.

2. **Code sharing:** React Native allows developers to write a significant portion of code in JavaScript, which can be used across both Android and iOS platforms. This code sharing capability results in faster development and easier maintenance.

3. **Native modules:** React Native provides native modules that allow developers to access platform-specific APIs and functionality. These modules can be written in Java or Objective-C/Swift and used in React Native components, enhancing the code reusability across platforms.

### Example code in React Native:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Text, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';

const MyButton = ({ text, onPress }) => {
  return (
    <TouchableOpacity onPress={onPress}>
      <Text>{text}</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  );
};

export default MyButton;
```

In this code snippet, a reusable button component `MyButton` is created using React Native's `TouchableOpacity` and `Text` components. This component can be reused throughout the application by passing different text and onPress functions.

## Conclusion

Both Flutter and React Native emphasize code reusability, enabling developers to write code once and use it across multiple platforms. Flutter's reactive programming model and widget-based architecture, along with React Native's component-based approach and JavaScript code sharing, offer powerful mechanisms to create reusable and efficient mobile applications.

When choosing between Flutter and React Native, consider the specific requirements of your project, the target platforms, and the skillset of your development team.
