Mobile app performance monitoring and analytics are essential for developers to ensure their apps are running smoothly and meeting user expectations. In this article, we will discuss some popular tools that can help monitor and analyze the performance of Flutter and React Native apps.

## 1. Firebase Performance Monitoring

Firebase Performance Monitoring is a robust tool that provides real-time monitoring and analysis of app performance. It offers detailed insights into app performance metrics such as app start time, screen render time, network requests, and user interactions. Firebase Performance Monitoring also allows you to create custom traces to measure specific areas of your app's performance.

The integration of Firebase Performance Monitoring with Flutter and React Native is straightforward. You can easily track performance metrics by adding a few lines of code to your app. Firebase's intuitive dashboard provides visualizations and alerts, making it easy to identify performance issues and take necessary actions.

For more information, you can visit the [Firebase Performance Monitoring documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon).
