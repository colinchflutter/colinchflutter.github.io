In any form-based application, validation is a crucial part of ensuring data integrity and user experience. Flutter, being a versatile cross-platform framework, provides various ways to manage and handle validation states seamlessly. In this blog post, we will explore different approaches to managing validation state in Flutter applications.

## Local Validation State

The simplest way to manage validation state in Flutter is by using local state variables within the widgets. This approach is suitable for small forms with a limited number of fields. You can define a boolean variable per field to represent the validation state. For instance:

```dart
bool isUsernameValid = false;
bool isPasswordValid = false;

...

TextField(
  onChanged: (value) {
    if (value.length >= 6) {
      setState(() {
        isUsernameValid = true;
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        isUsernameValid = false;
      });
    }
  },
  ...
),
```
 
Although local state management is straightforward, it can become complex and repetitive for larger forms with several input fields.

## Using GlobalKey

Another approach to managing validation state is by using GlobalKey in Flutter. GlobalKey allows accessing the state of the form from any part of the widget tree. This approach allows validating the form fields collectively without the need for multiple local state variables. Here's an example:

```dart
final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();

...

Form(
  key: _formKey,
  child: Column(
    children: [
      TextFormField(
        validator: (value) {
          if (value.length < 6) {
            return 'Please enter a valid username';
          }
          return null;
        },
        ...
      ),
      ...
    ],
  ),
)

...

RaisedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    if (_formKey.currentState.validate()) {
      // Form is valid, proceed with submission
    }
  },
  ...
),
```

By utilizing GlobalKey, we can leverage the built-in validation capabilities provided by Flutter's Form widget.

## Form Validation using Validators

Flutter also provides a validation utility class called `Validators`, which offers pre-defined validation functions for common use cases. This class helps facilitate form validation by reducing the amount of boilerplate code. Here's an example of using the `Validators` class:

```dart
TextFormField(
  validator: Validators.compose([
    Validators.required('This field is required'),
    Validators.email('Please enter a valid email'),
  ]),
  ...
),
```

The `Validators.compose` function allows chaining multiple validation functions together. It returns the appropriate error message if any of the validations fail; otherwise, it returns null.

## Third-Party Validation Libraries

In addition to the built-in validation features of Flutter, several third-party libraries offer advanced validation capabilities and additional validation rules. Some popular choices include `flutter_validators` and `flutter_form_validation`. These libraries provide an extensive range of validation functions and options, making it easier to handle complex form validation scenarios.

## Conclusion

Managing validation states is essential in any form-based application. In this blog post, we explored different approaches to managing validation states in Flutter applications, from local state management to utilising GlobalKey and Validators. We also highlighted the availability of third-party libraries for more advanced validation needs. Using these techniques, you can implement robust validation functionality in your Flutter apps and provide a seamless user experience.
