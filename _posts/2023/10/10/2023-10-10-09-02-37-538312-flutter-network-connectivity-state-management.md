In mobile app development, handling network connectivity is crucial to provide a seamless user experience. Flutter, with its rich set of libraries and tools, offers multiple approaches to manage network connectivity state in your applications. In this blog post, we will explore some of the popular techniques used in Flutter for network connectivity state management.

Let's dive into each of these techniques in detail.

## Connectivity Package

The `connectivity` package is one of the most widely used libraries in Flutter for managing network connectivity state. It provides a simple API to access network information and detect changes in network status.

To use the `connectivity` package, you need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  connectivity: ^2.0.2
```

After adding the package, you can monitor network state using the `Connectivity` class:

```dart
import 'package:connectivity/connectivity.dart';

class ConnectivityService {
  final Connectivity _connectivity = Connectivity();

  Stream<ConnectivityResult> get onConnectivityChanged =>
      _connectivity.onConnectivityChanged;
  
  Future<ConnectivityResult> checkConnectivity() =>
      _connectivity.checkConnectivity();
}
```

In the above example, we create a `ConnectivityService` class that exposes a `onConnectivityChanged` stream to monitor network state changes. You can subscribe to this stream and update your app's UI accordingly.

## Provider Package

The `provider` package is another popular state management solution in Flutter. It allows you to share data between different components of your application, making it ideal for managing global state, including network connectivity.

To use the `provider` package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  provider: ^5.0.0
```

In your provider file, define a `ConnectivityProvider`:

```dart
import 'package:connectivity/connectivity.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class ConnectivityProvider with ChangeNotifier {
  ConnectivityResult _connectivityResult;

  ConnectivityProvider() {
    Connectivity().onConnectivityChanged.listen((ConnectivityResult result) {
      _connectivityResult = result;
      notifyListeners();
    });
  }

  ConnectivityResult get connectivityResult => _connectivityResult;
}
```

In this example, we listen to the `onConnectivityChanged` stream from the `connectivity` package and update the `_connectivityResult` variable accordingly. Whenever the network state changes, we notify the listeners (UI elements) using the `notifyListeners()` method.

Now, you can use the `ConnectivityProvider` in your Flutter widgets to display the network connectivity state.

## BLoC Pattern

The BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern is a popular architectural pattern in Flutter for managing application state. It separates the business logic from the UI, making it easier to handle network connectivity state changes.

To implement the BLoC pattern for network connectivity, we can utilize the `flutter_bloc` package. 

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_bloc: ^7.0.0
```

Here's a basic example of how you can implement a connectivity BLoC using the `flutter_bloc` package:

```dart
import 'package:bloc/bloc.dart';
import 'package:connectivity/connectivity.dart';

enum ConnectivityEvent { check }

class ConnectivityBloc extends Bloc<ConnectivityEvent, ConnectivityResult> {
  final Connectivity _connectivity = Connectivity();

  @override
  ConnectivityResult get initialState => ConnectivityResult.none;

  @override
  Stream<ConnectivityResult> mapEventToState(ConnectivityEvent event) async* {
    if (event == ConnectivityEvent.check) {
      yield await _connectivity.checkConnectivity();
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a `ConnectivityBloc` that extends the `Bloc` class from the `flutter_bloc` package. We handle the `ConnectivityEvent.check` event and yield the network connectivity result using the `checkConnectivity()` method from the `connectivity` package.

By using the BLoC pattern, you can decouple the UI components from the business logic and leverage the power of streams to manage network connectivity state effectively.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored some of the popular techniques used in Flutter for network connectivity state management. These approaches, such as using the `connectivity` package, `provider` package, or implementing the BLoC pattern, provide flexibility and ease of use when it comes to monitoring and handling network connectivity changes.

By adopting any of these techniques based on your application's requirements and structure, you can ensure that your Flutter applications work seamlessly across different network conditions.
