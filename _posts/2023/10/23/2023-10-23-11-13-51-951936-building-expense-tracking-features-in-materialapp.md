Expense tracking is an essential feature in budgeting and financial management applications. It helps users stay organized and accountable for their spending. MaterialApp provides a comprehensive set of tools and widgets to build beautiful and intuitive user interfaces for tracking expenses.

## 2. Setting up the Project

Before diving into the details of expense tracking features, let's set up a new MaterialApp project. Assuming you have Dart and Flutter SDK installed, open your terminal and run the following commands:

```dart
$ flutter create expense_tracker
$ cd expense_tracker
```

This will create a new Flutter project named "expense_tracker" and navigate you into the project directory.
