Music recognition technology has gained immense popularity in recent years, allowing users to identify songs simply by recording a snippet of the music. With the advancements in machine learning and audio processing algorithms, integrating music recognition functionality into your mobile applications has become easier than ever before.

In this blog post, we will explore how to incorporate music recognition capabilities into your MaterialApp using the Acme Music Recognition API. Let's get started!

## Setting up the MaterialApp

First, make sure you have Flutter and the necessary dependencies installed on your system. Create a new Flutter project using the following command:

```
flutter create music_recognition_app
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd music_recognition_app
```

Open the project in your preferred code editor and replace the contents of `lib/main.dart` with the below code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    title: "Music Recognition App",
    home: Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Music Recognition"),
      ),
      body: Container(),
    ),
  ));
}
```

This code sets up a basic MaterialApp with a title and an empty body. Now, let's move on to integrating the Acme Music Recognition API.

## Integrating the Acme Music Recognition API

To use the Acme Music Recognition API, you'll need an API key. Head over to the Acme developer portal and sign up for an account if you don't have one already. Once you have your API key, add the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.3
```

Update the `lib/main.dart` file to include the necessary imports:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
```

Inside the `Widget build(BuildContext context)` method, add the following code snippet to perform the music recognition:

```dart
void recognizeMusic() async {
  String apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
  String apiUrl = "https://api.acme.com/music/recognize";

  // Implement audio recording logic here

  // Capture audio snippet and convert to base64

  // Make a POST request to the Acme Music Recognition API

  // Handle the response and extract the recognized song details
}

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text("Music Recognition"),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: recognizeMusic,
        child: Text("Record and Recognize"),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key. The `recognizeMusic` function will handle the logic for audio recording, converting the audio snippet to base64, making a POST request to the Acme Music Recognition API, and handling the response.

## Displaying the Recognized Song

To display the recognized song details, we need to modify the `recognizeMusic` function. Update the code as follows:

```dart
void recognizeMusic() async {
  // ...

  http.Response response = await http.post(
    Uri.parse(apiUrl),
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer $apiKey',
      'Content-Type': 'application/base64',
    },
    body: base64AudioData,
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // Parse the response and extract the song details

    String songTitle = /* Extracted song title */;
    String artistName = /* Extracted artist name */;

    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return AlertDialog(
          title: Text("Recognized Song"),
          content: Column(
            children: [
              Text("Title: $songTitle"),
              Text("Artist: $artistName"),
            ],
          ),
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () {
                Navigator.pop(context);
              },
              child: Text("OK"),
            ),
          ],
        );
      },
    );
  } else {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return AlertDialog(
          title: Text("Recognition Failed"),
          content: Text("Unable to recognize the song."),
          actions: [
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () {
                Navigator.pop(context);
              },
              child: Text("OK"),
            ),
          ],
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

This code makes a POST request to the Acme Music Recognition API and handles the response accordingly. If the recognition is successful, it displays an AlertDialog with the recognized song details. Otherwise, it shows an error message.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to integrate music recognition capabilities into your MaterialApp using the Acme Music Recognition API. By following the steps outlined above, you can enable users to identify songs effortlessly within your application. Remember to handle user permissions and ensure a smooth user experience.

Happy coding! ðŸŽµðŸš€
