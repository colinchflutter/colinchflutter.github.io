## Introduction
In today's fast-paced world, keeping track of expenses and sharing bills with friends or roommates can be challenging. Luckily, with the power of technology, we can now create expense splitting and bill sharing apps to make this process easier. In this blog post, we'll explore how to build such an app using the **MaterialApp** package in Flutter.

## Setting up the MaterialApp
To get started, make sure you have Flutter and the MaterialApp package installed. Create a new Flutter project and import the necessary dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file. The MaterialApp package provides a set of reusable widgets and themes that follow the Material Design guidelines.

To set up the MaterialApp widget as the root of your app, open the `main.dart` file and update the `runApp()` method as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Expense Splitter',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ExpenseSplittingScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Creating the Expense Splitting Screens
Next, let's create the screens for managing expenses and splitting bills. In your project folder, create a new file called `expense_splitting_screen.dart` and define the `ExpenseSplittingScreen` class. This class will be the home screen of our app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class ExpenseSplittingScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ExpenseSplittingScreenState createState() => _ExpenseSplittingScreenState();
}

class _ExpenseSplittingScreenState extends State<ExpenseSplittingScreen> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Expense Splitter'),
      ),
      body: Container(
        // Add your UI widgets here
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

To create additional screens, simply create new files and classes following a similar pattern.

## Implementing Expense Splitting Functionality
Now that we have our screens set up, let's implement the expense splitting functionality. We can use state management solutions like **Provider** or **GetX** to manage the app's state and handle the logic. This allows us to update the UI based on user interactions and keep track of expenses.

For simplicity, let's assume that the user can add expenses with a description and amount. We'll use a ListView to display the list of added expenses. To add expenses, we can use a floating action button that opens a dialog where the user can enter the details.

## Sharing Bills with Friends
One of the key features of our expense splitting app is the ability to share bills with friends. To implement this, we can create a separate screen where the user can enter the bill details and select friends to split the bill with. We can use checkboxes or other input widgets to allow the user to select friends from their contact list or manually enter their names.

Once the bill is shared, our app can calculate the amount owed by each friend and display it. We can utilize a data structure like a HashMap to keep track of the friends and their respective shares.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we've explored how to create an expense splitting and bill sharing app using the MaterialApp package in Flutter. We started by setting up the MaterialApp widget as the root of our app, then created the necessary screens and implemented the expense splitting functionality. Finally, we discussed how to share bills with friends and calculate the amount owed by each friend. By following these steps, you can build a powerful and user-friendly expense splitting app using Flutter and MaterialApp.

Happy coding! #Flutter #MaterialApp
