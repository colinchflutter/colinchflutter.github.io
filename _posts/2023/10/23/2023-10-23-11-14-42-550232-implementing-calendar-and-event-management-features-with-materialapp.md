In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement calendar and event management features using the `MaterialApp` package in Flutter. We will create a simple application where users can add events to their calendar and view them in a visually appealing way.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:
- Flutter installed on your system
- Basic knowledge of Flutter and Dart programming

## Setting up the Project
1. Create a new Flutter project using the following command in your terminal:
```dart
flutter create calendar_app
```
2. Change to the newly created project directory:
```dart
cd calendar_app
```
3. Open the project in your favorite code editor.

## Creating the Calendar View
1. Import the `flutter/material.dart` package:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```
2. Define a `CalendarPage` class that extends `StatefulWidget`:
```dart
class CalendarPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CalendarPageState createState() => _CalendarPageState();
}
```
3. Define the `_CalendarPageState` class that extends `State<CalendarPage>`:
```dart
class _CalendarPageState extends State<CalendarPage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Calendar App'),
      ),
      body: Container(
        child: Text('Calendar View'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
4. In the `lib/main.dart` file, replace the existing code with the following:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'calendar_page.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: CalendarPage(),
  ));
}
```
5. Save the changes and run the application using the following command:
```dart
flutter run
```

Now you should see a blank screen with the title "Calendar App".

## Adding Event Management
1. Create a new Dart file called `event_page.dart`.
2. Define a `EventPage` class that extends `StatefulWidget` similar to the `CalendarPage`:
```dart
class EventPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _EventPageState createState() => _EventPageState();
}
```
3. Define the `_EventPageState` class that extends `State<EventPage>` similarly to the `_CalendarPageState`:
```dart
class _EventPageState extends State<EventPage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Event Manager'),
      ),
      body: Container(
        child: Text('Event View'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
4. In the `lib/main.dart` file, import the `event_page.dart` file and add a new `FloatingActionButton` to navigate to the `EventPage`:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'calendar_page.dart';
import 'event_page.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: CalendarPage(),
    routes: <String, WidgetBuilder>{
      '/event': (BuildContext context) => EventPage(),
    },
  ));
}
```
5. Save the changes and run the application again. Now you should see a floating action button in the top-right corner of the calendar view.
6. Tap the floating action button, and you will be navigated to the event management page.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to implement calendar and event management features using the `MaterialApp` package in Flutter. We created a simple application where users can view a calendar and manage their events. By following this tutorial, you can now build upon this foundation to create a fully functional event management application with Flutter.
