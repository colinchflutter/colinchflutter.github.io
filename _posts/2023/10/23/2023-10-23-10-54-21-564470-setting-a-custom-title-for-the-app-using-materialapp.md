When developing a Flutter app, setting a catchy and descriptive title is essential, as it helps users identify and remember your app. By default, Flutter apps display the app name specified in the `pubspec.yaml` file. However, you can easily customize the title displayed in the app's title bar using the `MaterialApp` widget.

In this blog post, we will explore how to set a custom title for your Flutter app using the `MaterialApp` widget. Let's get started!

## Using the `title` Property

The simplest way to set a custom title for your app is by utilizing the `title` property of the `MaterialApp` widget. This property allows you to define a string that will be displayed as the app's title.

Here's an example of setting a custom title using the `title` property:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    title: 'My Awesome App',
    home: MyHomePage(),
  ));
}
```

In the above code snippet, the `title` property is set to `'My Awesome App'`. When the app is launched, this string will be displayed as the title.

## Setting the `AppBar` Title

Another way to set a custom title for your app is by utilizing the `AppBar` widget. The `AppBar` widget provides a variety of customization options, including the title. By using the `AppBar` widget, you can add additional features such as logo, actions, etc., to the title bar.

Here's an example of setting the `AppBar` title:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('My Awesome App'),
      ),
      body: MyHomePage(),
    ),
  ));
}
```

In the code snippet above, we have wrapped the `MaterialApp` widget with a `Scaffold` widget. Inside the `Scaffold`, we have defined an `AppBar` widget with the `title` property set to `'My Awesome App'`. This will display the custom title in the app's title bar.

## Conclusion

Customizing the title of your Flutter app is an effective way to create a unique branding experience for your users. In this blog post, we explored two methods of setting a custom title using the `MaterialApp` widget.

To summarize, you can set a custom title by using the `title` property directly in the `MaterialApp` widget or by utilizing the `AppBar` widget and adding it to a `Scaffold`. Experiment with these techniques to find the one that best suits your app's design and branding.
