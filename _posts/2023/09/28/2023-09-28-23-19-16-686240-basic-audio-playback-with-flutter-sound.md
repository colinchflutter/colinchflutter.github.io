In this blog post, we will explore how to implement basic audio playback functionality using Flutter Sound, a powerful audio plugin for Flutter.

## Why use Flutter Sound?

*Flutter Sound* provides a convenient and straightforward way to handle audio playback in your Flutter applications. With its extensive features, you can easily load and play various audio files, control playback, and even visualize audio data.

## Getting started

To get started, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. Then, create a new Flutter project and add the *flutter_sound* package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_sound: ^X.X.X # Replace with the latest version
```

Next, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

## Loading an audio file

To play an audio file, first, import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';
```

Next, create an instance of the `FlutterSoundPlayer` class:

```dart
FlutterSoundPlayer _player = FlutterSoundPlayer();
```

Load an audio file by providing the file path as a parameter to the `openAudio` method:

```dart
_player.openAudio('path/to/audio/file.mp3');
```

## Playing and pausing audio

To play the loaded audio, use the `startPlayer` method:

```dart
_player.startPlayer();
```

To pause the audio playback, use the `pausePlayer` method:

```dart
_player.pausePlayer();
```

## Seeking audio

You can seek to a specific position in the audio by calling the `seekToPlayer` method with the desired position in milliseconds:

```dart
_player.seekToPlayer(Duration(milliseconds: 5000));
```

## Handling audio completion

To handle audio completion, add an event listener using the `onPlayerStateChanged` property:

```dart
_player.onPlayerStateChanged.listen((e) {
  if (e == PlayerState.STOPPED) {
    // Audio playback completed
    // Add your logic here
  }
});
```
