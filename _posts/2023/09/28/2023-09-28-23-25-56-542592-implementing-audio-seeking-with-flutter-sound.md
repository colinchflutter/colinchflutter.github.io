Flutter Sound is a powerful audio plugin that allows developers to record, play, and manipulate audio in their Flutter applications. In this article, we will explore how to implement audio seeking with Flutter Sound.

## What is audio seeking?

Audio seeking refers to the ability to jump to a specific position in an audio file. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as allowing users to skip forward or backward in a podcast or audio book, or providing a progress bar for tracking the playback position.

## Implementing audio seeking

To implement audio seeking with Flutter Sound, we will leverage the `seekToPlayer` method provided by the `AudioPlayer` class. This method allows us to seek to a specified position in the audio file.

Here's an example code snippet to demonstrate how to implement audio seeking with Flutter Sound:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';

class AudioPlayerController {
  FlutterSoundPlayer _audioPlayer;
  bool _isPlaying = false;
  double _currentPosition = 0;
  double _totalDuration = 0;

  void initializePlayer(String audioFilePath) {
    _audioPlayer = FlutterSoundPlayer();
    _audioPlayer.openAudioSession().then((value) {
      _audioPlayer.setSubscriptionDuration(Duration(milliseconds: 10));
      _audioPlayer.onProgress = (position, duration) {
        _currentPosition = position.inMilliseconds.toDouble();
        _totalDuration = duration.inMilliseconds.toDouble();
      };
    });
  }

  void seekToPosition(double milliseconds) {
    if (_audioPlayer != null) {
      _audioPlayer.seekToPlayer(Duration(milliseconds: milliseconds.toInt()));
    }
  }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we create an `AudioPlayerController` class that encapsulates the logic for playing and seeking audio. The `initializePlayer` method initializes the audio player and sets up a callback for receiving progress updates. The `seekToPosition` method allows us to seek to a specified position in milliseconds.

To use the `AudioPlayerController`, you can call `initializePlayer` with the path to the audio file and then use `seekToPosition` to seek to the desired position.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored how to implement audio seeking with Flutter Sound. By leveraging the `seekToPlayer` method provided by the `AudioPlayer` class, we can easily jump to a specific position in an audio file. This functionality can be used to enhance the user experience of audio applications in Flutter.
