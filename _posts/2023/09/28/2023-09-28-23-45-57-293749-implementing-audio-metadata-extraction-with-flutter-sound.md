Flutter Sound is a powerful audio recording and playback package for Flutter, which allows you to easily work with audio in your Flutter applications. One useful feature of Flutter Sound is its ability to extract metadata from audio files. In this article, we will walk through the process of implementing audio metadata extraction with Flutter Sound.

## Installing Flutter Sound

To get started, you need to install the Flutter Sound package in your Flutter project. Simply add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_sound:
    git:
      url: git://github.com/dooboolab/flutter_sound.git
```

Then, run the following command to fetch the package:

```
flutter pub get
```

## Extracting audio metadata

Once you have Flutter Sound installed, you can easily extract audio metadata using the `flutter_sound` package. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. Import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sound/android_encoder.dart';
```

2. Create an instance of `FlutterSoundPlayer`:

```dart
FlutterSoundPlayer _flutterSoundPlayer = FlutterSoundPlayer();
```

3. Open the audio file and retrieve its metadata:

```dart
Future<void> getAudioMetadata() async {
  await _flutterSoundPlayer.openAudioSession();
  
  String audioFilePath = 'path_to_audio_file.mp3'; // Replace with your audio file path
  MediaMetaData mediaMetaData =
      await _flutterSoundPlayer.getMediaMetaData(audioFilePath);
  
  print('Title: ${mediaMetaData.title}');
  print('Artist: ${mediaMetaData.artist}');
  print('Album: ${mediaMetaData.album}');
  // ... and so on
}
```

4. Close the audio session when you're done:

```dart
void dispose() {
  _flutterSoundPlayer.closeAudioSession();
  super.dispose();
}
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we have learned how to implement audio metadata extraction with Flutter Sound. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily retrieve metadata such as the title, artist, and album from audio files in your Flutter applications. This can be especially useful when building music player apps or any application that requires working with audio files. Start exploring the capabilities of Flutter Sound and enhance your Flutter apps with audio features!
