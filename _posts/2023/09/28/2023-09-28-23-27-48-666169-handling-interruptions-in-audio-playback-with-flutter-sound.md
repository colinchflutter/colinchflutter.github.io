In mobile app development, having a seamless audio playback experience is crucial for creating a user-friendly application. However, interruptions from incoming calls, notifications, or system events can disrupt the audio playback and result in a less satisfactory user experience.

In this blog post, we will explore how to handle interruptions in audio playback using [Flutter Sound](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_sound). Flutter Sound is a powerful audio playback and recording plugin for Flutter that provides a wide range of features and capabilities.

### Detecting interruptions

Before we can handle interruptions in audio playback, we need to be able to detect when an interruption occurs. Flutter Sound provides a callback function, `onStateChanged`, which can be used to listen for changes in the audio player's state. We can use this function to detect interruptions in audio playback.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';

class AudioPlayer {
  FlutterSoundPlayer _player;

  void initPlayer() {
    _player = FlutterSoundPlayer();
    _player.onStateChanged.listen((AudioPlaybackState state) {
      if (state == AudioPlaybackState.interrupted) {
        // Handle interruption
      }
    });
  }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we create an instance of the `FlutterSoundPlayer` and initialize it. We then listen for changes in the audio player's state using the `onStateChanged` callback. When the state changes to `AudioPlaybackState.interrupted`, we can handle the interruption as needed.

### Pausing and resuming playback

When an interruption occurs, we typically want to pause the audio playback and resume it once the interruption is over. Flutter Sound provides methods to pause and resume the audio playback.

```dart
class AudioPlayer {
  FlutterSoundPlayer _player;
  AudioPlaybackState _lastPlaybackState;

  void pausePlayback() async {
    if (_player.isPlaying) {
      _lastPlaybackState = _player.state;
      await _player.pausePlayer();
    }
  }

  void resumePlayback() async {
    if (_lastPlaybackState == AudioPlaybackState.playing) {
      await _player.resumePlayer();
    }
    _lastPlaybackState = null;
  }
}
```

In the code above, we define two methods: `pausePlayback` and `resumePlayback`. When an interruption occurs, we check if the audio player is currently playing. If it is, we pause the player and store the last playback state. Once the interruption is over, we can then resume playback using the `resumePlayback` method.

### Conclusion

Handling interruptions in audio playback is essential for creating a smooth and uninterrupted audio experience in your Flutter applications. With the help of Flutter Sound and its `onStateChanged` callback, we can easily detect interruptions and pause/resume audio playback accordingly.

Remember to always prioritize the user experience by minimizing disruptions caused by interruptions.
