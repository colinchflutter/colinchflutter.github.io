Flutter Sound is a powerful audio plugin for Flutter that allows us to record and play audio files. In this blog post, we will learn how to implement an audio waveform display using Flutter Sound and visualize the audio data in real-time.

## Getting Started with Flutter Sound

To get started, we need to add the Flutter Sound package to our Flutter project. Open your pubspec.yaml file and add the following dependency:

```
dependencies:
  flutter_sound: ^4.1.8
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

## Recording Audio

Let's start by recording audio using Flutter Sound. We first need to import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
import 'dart:io';
```

Next, we need to create an instance of the Flutter Sound plugin and initialize it:

```dart
FlutterSound flutterSound = FlutterSound();
await flutterSound.openAudioSession();
```

To start recording audio, we can use the `startRecorder()` method:

```dart
final appDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
final filePath = '${appDir.path}/recording.aac';
await flutterSound.startRecorder(toFile: filePath);
```

To stop recording, we can use the `stopRecorder()` method:

```dart
await flutterSound.stopRecorder();
```

## Displaying the Audio Waveform

To display the audio waveform, we can use the `flutter_visualizers` package. Add the following dependency in your pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_visualizers: ^0.0.2
```

We then need to import the necessary packages and define a `WaveformVisualizer` widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_visualizers/widgets.dart';

class WaveformDisplay extends StatefulWidget {
  final String audioPath;

  const WaveformDisplay({Key? key, required this.audioPath}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _WaveformDisplayState createState() => _WaveformDisplayState();
}

class _WaveformDisplayState extends State<WaveformDisplay> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return WaveformVisualizer(
      asset: widget.audioPath,
      waveFormType: WaveFormType.material,
    );
  }
}
```

We can now use the `WaveformDisplay` widget in our app and pass the path of the recorded audio file:

```dart
WaveformDisplay(audioPath: filePath),
```

Make sure to replace `filePath` with the actual path of the recorded audio file.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to implement audio waveform display using Flutter Sound and the `flutter_visualizers` package. We covered recording audio using Flutter Sound and displaying the audio waveform in real-time. By visualizing the audio data, we can enhance the user experience in audio-related applications.
