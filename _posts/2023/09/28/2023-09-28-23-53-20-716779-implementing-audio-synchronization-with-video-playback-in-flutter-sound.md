Flutter Sound is a powerful audio recording and playback library for Flutter applications. In this article, we will explore how to synchronize audio playback with video playback using Flutter Sound.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have Flutter Sound set up in your Flutter project. You can follow the official documentation on how to install and set up Flutter Sound.

## 1. Playing Video Using Flutter Video Player

To start with, we'll implement video playback in our Flutter app using the Flutter Video Player package. Install the package by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_video_player: ^0.4.0
```

Import the necessary files in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_video_player/flutter_video_player.dart';
```

Now, create an instance of the `VideoPlayerController` and configure it with the video URL:

```dart
final VideoPlayerController _videoController = VideoPlayerController.network('your_video_url');
```

To play the video, call the `initialize` method and then call `play`:

```dart
_videoController.initialize().then((_) {
  _videoController.play();
});
```

## 2. Adding Audio to Flutter Sound

Now that we have video playback set up, let's integrate audio playback using the Flutter Sound library. Import the necessary files:

```dart
import 'package:just_audio/just_audio.dart';
```

Create an instance of `AudioPlayer` and load your audio file:

```dart
final AudioPlayer _audioPlayer = AudioPlayer();
_audioPlayer.setAsset('your_audio_file.mp3');
```

To play the audio, call the `play` method:

```dart
_audioPlayer.play();
```

## 3. Synchronizing Audio and Video Playback

To synchronize the audio and video playback, we need to listen to the video's playback position and update the audio playback accordingly.

Start by adding a listener to the video controller to get the current playback position:

```dart
_videoController.addListener(() {
  Duration position = _videoController.value.position;
  // Update the audio player position based on the video playback position
  _audioPlayer.seek(position);
});
```

To ensure smooth synchronization, we need to continuously update the audio player's position as the video playback progresses. We will achieve this using a `StreamBuilder`:

```dart
StreamBuilder<Duration>(
  stream: _videoController.position,
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    if (!snapshot.hasData) return Container();
    Duration position = snapshot.data;
    // Update the audio player position based on the video playback position
    _audioPlayer.seek(position);
    return Container();
  }
);
```

With this implementation, the audio playback should stay synchronized with the video playback. You can pause, resume, or seek in the video, and the audio will adjust accordingly.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have learned how to synchronize audio playback with video playback using Flutter Sound. By leveraging the Flutter Video Player package and integrating it with the Flutter Sound library, we can easily create immersive audio-video experiences in our Flutter applications.
