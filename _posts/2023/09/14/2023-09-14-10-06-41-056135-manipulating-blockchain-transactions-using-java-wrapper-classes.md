Blockchain technology has gained significant popularity in recent years for its robustness, immutability, and security. One key aspect of blockchain is its ability to handle and process transactions. In this article, we will explore how we can manipulate blockchain transactions using Java wrapper classes.

## Understanding Blockchain Transactions

A blockchain transaction represents the transfer of value or information from one party to another within the blockchain network. Transactions consist of various components such as input and output addresses, transaction hash, transaction fees, and more.

## Using Java Wrapper Classes

To interact with blockchain transactions in Java, we can utilize wrapper classes that provide convenient methods and functionalities to manipulate transactions effectively. Let's take a look at some commonly used Java wrapper classes and their functionalities.

### 1. BitcoinJ

BitcoinJ is a Java library that enables developers to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain. It provides a set of classes and methods to work with Bitcoin transactions. With BitcoinJ, you can create, sign, and submit transactions to the Bitcoin network. Here's an example of creating a simple Bitcoin transaction using BitcoinJ:

```java
import org.bitcoinj.core.*;
import org.bitcoinj.params.*;
import org.bitcoinj.wallet.*;

// Create a new transaction
Transaction tx = new Transaction(NetworkParameters.testNet());

// Add an output to the transaction (sending Bitcoin to a specific address)
Address recipientAddress = Address.fromString(NetworkParameters.testNet(), "<Recipient Address>");
tx.addOutput(Coin.parseCoin("<Amount in Satoshis>"), recipientAddress);

// Sign the transaction with the sender's private key
ECKey recipientKey = Wallet.fromPrivateKey(NetworkParameters.testNet(), "<Sender Private Key>").getKey();
tx.signInputs(SigHash.ALL, recipientKey);

// Broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network
PeerGroup peerGroup = new PeerGroup(NetworkParameters.testNet());
peerGroup.start();
peerGroup.broadcastTransaction(tx).broadcast();

// Print the transaction hash
System.out.println("Transaction Hash: " + tx.getHashAsString());
```
### 2. EthereumJ

EthereumJ is a Java library that allows developers to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It provides various wrapper classes and APIs to create, sign, and submit Ethereum transactions. Here's an example of creating an Ethereum transaction using EthereumJ:

```java
import org.ethereum.core.*;
import org.ethereum.crypto.*;
import org.ethereum.util.*;

// Create a new transaction
Transaction tx = new Transaction(
    ByteUtil.hexStringToBytes("<Sender Address>"),
    ByteUtil.hexStringToBytes("<Recipient Address>"),
    new BigInteger("<Amount in Wei>"),
    new BigInteger("<Gas Limit>"),
    new BigInteger("<Gas Price>"),
    ByteUtil.hexStringToBytes("<Optional Data>")
);

// Sign the transaction with the sender's private key
ECKey senderKey = ECKey.fromPrivate(ByteUtil.hexStringToBytes("<Sender Private Key>"));
tx.sign(senderKey);

// Broadcast the transaction to the Ethereum network
Ethereum ethereum = EthereumFactory.createEthereum();
ethereum.submitTransaction(tx);

// Print the transaction hash
System.out.println("Transaction Hash: " + tx.getHash());
```

## Conclusion

Manipulating blockchain transactions using Java wrapper classes provides developers with an efficient way to interact with various blockchain networks. Whether it's Bitcoin or Ethereum, these wrapper classes offer the necessary functionalities to create, sign, and submit transactions seamlessly. By leveraging the power of blockchain transactions, we can build secure and transparent applications that enhance the digital economy.
