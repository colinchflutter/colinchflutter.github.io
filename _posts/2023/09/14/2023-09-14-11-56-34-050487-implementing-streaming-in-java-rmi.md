## Setting up the project

To begin, let's create a simple project structure. We'll need two Java classes - a server class and a client class.

```java
// Server.java
import java.rmi.Remote;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;
import java.io.InputStream;

public interface Server extends Remote {
    InputStream getInputStream(String filename) throws RemoteException;
}

// ServerImpl.java
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;
import java.io.*;

public class ServerImpl extends UnicastRemoteObject implements Server {
    protected ServerImpl() throws RemoteException {
        super();
    }

    public InputStream getInputStream(String filename) throws RemoteException {
        try {
            File file = new File(filename);
            return new FileInputStream(file);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return null;
        }
    }
}

// Client.java
import java.rmi.Naming;
import java.io.*;

public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Server server = (Server) Naming.lookup("//localhost/Server");
            InputStream inputStream = server.getInputStream("file.txt");
            // Use the input stream for further processing
            // ...
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementing streaming with RMI

To implement streaming in Java RMI, we need to define an interface that extends the `Remote` marker interface. This interface will include a method for retrieving an `InputStream` object.

In the example above, the `Server` interface defines the `getInputStream()` method, which takes a filename as input and returns an `InputStream` object. The `ServerImpl` class implements this interface and provides an implementation for the `getInputStream()` method by creating a `FileInputStream` for the given file.

On the client side, the `Client` class demonstrates how to use the `getInputStream()` method on the remote server object obtained through RMI. It calls the `getInputStream()` method on the `server` object to retrieve the `InputStream` object, which can be used for further processing, such as reading the stream and performing data operations.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how streaming can be implemented in Java RMI. By creating an interface with a method returning an `InputStream`, and implementing that interface on the server side, we can provide streaming capabilities over RMI. The client can then retrieve the `InputStream` to consume the stream for further processing.
