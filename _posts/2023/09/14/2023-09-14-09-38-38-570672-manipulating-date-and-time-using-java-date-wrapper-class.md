When working with dates and times in Java, it is common to use the `java.util.Date` class. While this class provides the basic functionality for representing a specific point in time, it lacks some important features for manipulating dates and times. To address this, you can make use of the `java.util.Calendar` class which provides more methods for manipulating date and time values.

## Creating a Date Object

To create a `Date` object representing the current date and time, simply use the `new Date()` constructor. This will initialize the `Date` object with the current date and time.

```java
import java.util.Date;

Date currentDate = new Date();
System.out.println(currentDate);
```

Output:
```
Mon May 24 10:30:15 GMT 2021
```

## Manipulating Dates and Times

To manipulate dates and times, you can use the `Calendar` class. It provides methods to add or subtract specific units such as days, months, or years to a given `Date` object.

Here's an example of adding 7 days to the current date:

```java
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.Date;

Date currentDate = new Date();
Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
calendar.setTime(currentDate);
calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 7);

Date newDate = calendar.getTime();
System.out.println(newDate);
```

Output:
```
Mon May 31 10:30:15 GMT 2021
```

Similarly, you can subtract days, months, or years by using negative values. For example, to subtract 3 months from the current date:

```java
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.Date;

Date currentDate = new Date();
Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
calendar.setTime(currentDate);
calendar.add(Calendar.MONTH, -3);

Date newDate = calendar.getTime();
System.out.println(newDate);
```

Output:
```
Fri February 24 10:30:15 GMT 2021
```

## Formatting Dates and Times

Once you have a `Date` object, you can format it into a specific format using the `SimpleDateFormat` class.

```java
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;

Date currentDate = new Date();
SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy");

String formattedDate = dateFormat.format(currentDate);
System.out.println(formattedDate);
```

Output:
```
24/05/2021
```

## Conclusion

Java's `Date` wrapper class provides the basic functionality for working with dates and times. However, when it comes to manipulating dates, the `Calendar` class offers more flexibility. By combining these two classes, you can effectively handle date and time operations in Java.
