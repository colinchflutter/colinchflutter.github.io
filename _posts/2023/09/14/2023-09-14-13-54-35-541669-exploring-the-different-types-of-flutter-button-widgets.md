Flutter provides developers with a wide variety of button widgets that can be used to create interactive and responsive user interfaces. In this blog post, we will take a closer look at some of the most commonly used button widgets in Flutter and explore their features and use cases.

## `ElevatedButton`

The `ElevatedButton` widget is one of the most basic and commonly used button widgets in Flutter. It is a material design raised button, commonly used in forms, dialogs, and other areas of the user interface where the user is expected to perform a primary action.

To create an `ElevatedButton`, you can use the following code:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Perform action on button press
  },
  child: Text('Press Me'),
)
```

## `FlatButton`

The `FlatButton` widget is another commonly used button widget in Flutter. It is a material design flat button that can be used to trigger secondary actions or non-destructive actions.

To create a `FlatButton`, you can use the following code:

```dart
FlatButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Perform action on button press
  },
  child: Text('Press Me'),
)
```

## `OutlinedButton`

The `OutlinedButton` widget is a material design outlined button that can be used when you want to emphasize a button in a layout with other buttons or content.

To create an `OutlinedButton`, you can use the following code:

```dart
OutlinedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Perform action on button press
  },
  child: Text('Press Me'),
)
```

## `IconButton`

The `IconButton` widget is a button that can be used to trigger actions with an icon. It is typically used for actions that do not require a lot of descriptive text.

To create an `IconButton`, you can use the following code:

```dart
IconButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Perform action on button press
  },
  icon: Icon(Icons.favorite),
)
```

These are just a few examples of the button widgets available in Flutter. There are many more widgets with additional features and customization options. By leveraging these button widgets, you can create interactive and engaging user interfaces for your Flutter applications.
