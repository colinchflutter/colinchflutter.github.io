Encryption and decryption are essential techniques used to secure sensitive data. In Java, the `javax.crypto` package provides various classes and methods to implement encryption and decryption functionalities. In this article, we will explore the usage of wrapper classes to simplify the process of encryption and decryption.

## Wrapper Classes in Encryption

Wrapper classes act as a bridge between the cryptographic algorithms and the data to be encrypted. They provide a convenient way of performing encryption operations without dealing with low-level cryptographic details.

One commonly used wrapper class in Java is the `Cipher` class. Here's how you can use it for encryption:

```java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;

public class EncryptionExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        //Generating a secret key
        KeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        SecretKey secretKey = keyGenerator.generateKey();

        //Creating Cipher object and initializing it with the secret key
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);

        //Encrypting the data
        byte[] encryptedData = cipher.doFinal("Hello, World!".getBytes());

        System.out.println("Encrypted Data: " + new String(encryptedData));
    }
}
```

In the above example, we first create a secret key using the `KeyGenerator` class. The `Cipher` class is then used to create an instance of the AES encryption algorithm and initialize it with the secret key. Finally, we encrypt the data by calling the `doFinal` method on the cipher object.

## Wrapper Classes in Decryption

Similarly, when it comes to decryption, wrapper classes simplify the process. Here's an example of using the `Cipher` class for decryption:

```java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;

public class DecryptionExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        //Initializing Cipher object for decryption
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
        cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey);

        //Decrypting the data
        byte[] decryptedData = cipher.doFinal(encryptedData);

        System.out.println("Decrypted Data: " + new String(decryptedData));
    }
}
```

In the above example, we initialize the `Cipher` object with the same encryption algorithm used previously and specify the decryption mode. Then, we decrypt the data using the `doFinal` method.

## Conclusion

Wrapper classes in Java, such as the `Cipher` class, provide a simplified way to implement encryption and decryption functionalities. By abstracting the underlying cryptographic details, they allow developers to focus on the higher-level encryption and decryption operations.

Using wrapper classes not only saves time but also ensures that encryption and decryption are performed securely. By leveraging the power of these wrapper classes, developers can implement robust data security measures in their applications.
