The popularity of carpooling and ride-sharing services has been on the rise in recent years. Many people are now looking for more sustainable transportation options and are willing to share rides with others going in the same direction. If you are building a carpool or ride-sharing app, Flutter's Carpool widget can be a useful tool to simplify the implementation process.

## What is the Carpool widget?

Flutter's Carpool widget is a pre-built UI component that provides the necessary elements to create a carpool or ride-sharing app. It includes user profile pictures, pick-up and drop-off locations, and real-time location tracking. With a few customizations, you can have a functional carpooling module in your app.

## Getting started with Carpool widget

To use the Carpool widget in your Flutter app, you need to add the `flutter_carpool` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_carpool: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the package, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the dependencies.

## Using the Carpool widget

1. Import the necessary classes from the `flutter_carpool` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_carpool/carpool.dart';
import 'package:flutter_carpool/models/user.dart';
```

2. Create a list of users participating in the carpool:

```dart
List<User> users = [
  User(name: 'John Doe', profilePicture: 'assets/images/john.png'),
  User(name: 'Jane Smith', profilePicture: 'assets/images/jane.png'),
  User(name: 'Alex Johnson', profilePicture: 'assets/images/alex.png'),
];
```

3. Use the `CarpoolWidget` to display the carpool information:

```dart
CarpoolWidget(
  users: users,
  pickUpLocation: 'Central Park',
  dropOffLocation: 'Times Square',
);
```

## Customizing the Carpool widget

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the Carpool widget to match your app's design and requirements. The `CarpoolWidget` accepts various parameters that allow you to modify its behavior. Some of the common customization options include:

- **Profile Picture Shape**: You can change the shape of the profile pictures from the default circular shape to square or rounded.
- **Profile Picture Size**: You can adjust the size of the profile pictures to make them larger or smaller.
- **Pick-up and Drop-off Location Icons**: You can customize the icons used to represent the pick-up and drop-off locations.
- **Real-time Location Tracking**: You can enable real-time location tracking to show the current location of the participants on a map.

## Conclusion

Incorporating carpool and ride-sharing functionality into your app is now easier with Flutter's Carpool widget. By leveraging this pre-built UI component, you can quickly create a visually appealing and user-friendly carpooling module. Don't miss out on the opportunity to make your app more sustainable and eco-friendly with carpooling functionality!
