In today's world of distributed computing, managing data across multiple databases is a common challenge. One way to tackle this is by using wrapper classes in Java. Wrapper classes can provide a simple and efficient way to manipulate data in distributed databases.

## What are Java wrapper classes?

Java wrapper classes are classes that encapsulate primitive data types and provide additional methods and functionalities. They allow us to treat primitives like objects, which can be useful when working with distributed databases.

## Advantages of using Java wrapper classes for data manipulation

1. **Simplified data manipulation**: With wrapper classes, we can easily manipulate data in distributed databases using familiar Java syntax. We can perform operations like data retrieval, modification, and deletion without worrying about the intricacies of distributed database systems.

2. **Cross-database compatibility**: Wrapper classes provide a layer of abstraction that makes it easier to work with different database systems. This allows us to write code that works seamlessly across multiple databases, saving us from the hassle of writing different logic for each database.

3. **Error handling**: Java wrapper classes often come with built-in error handling mechanisms. They throw exceptions when there are issues with database operations, helping us handle errors efficiently and ensuring data consistency.

## Example: Using Java wrapper classes to manipulate data in distributed databases

Let's see an example of how we can use Java wrapper classes to manipulate data in distributed databases using the popular Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API.

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class DataManipulationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Connection connection = null;
        PreparedStatement preparedStatement = null;
        ResultSet resultSet = null;
        
        try {
            // Establish database connection
            connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "username", "password");

            // Prepare a SQL statement
            String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ?";
            preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(sql);

            // Set parameter values
            preparedStatement.setInt(1, 18);

            // Execute the query
            resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();

            // Process the results
            while (resultSet.next()) {
                String name = resultSet.getString("name");
                int age = resultSet.getInt("age");
                System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            // Close the resources
            try { resultSet.close(); } catch (Exception e) {}
            try { preparedStatement.close(); } catch (Exception e) {}
            try { connection.close(); } catch (Exception e) {}
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, we use the JDBC API to connect to a MySQL database and retrieve records where the age is greater than a specified value. The `PreparedStatement` class is a wrapper class that helps us construct and execute parameterized SQL queries.

## Conclusion

Java wrapper classes offer a convenient way to manipulate data in distributed databases. They simplify data manipulation, provide cross-database compatibility, and offer error handling mechanisms. By using wrapper classes like `PreparedStatement`, we can write efficient and maintainable code to interact with distributed databases.
