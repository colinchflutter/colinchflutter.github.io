In today's fast-paced world, finding parking can be a hassle. Luckily, with the power of technology, we can develop parking reservation apps to make this process easier and more convenient for users. One powerful tool for developing such apps is Flutter's parking widget.

## What is Flutter's Parking Widget?

Flutter is a popular open-source UI framework developed by Google for building cross-platform applications. Flutter's parking widget is a pre-built component that allows developers to integrate parking reservation functionality into their apps with ease. 

## Getting Started

To start developing a parking reservation app with Flutter's parking widget, you'll need to have Flutter and Dart installed on your system. Once you have them set up, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Flutter project using the command `flutter create parking_reservation_app`.
2. Open the project in your favorite code editor.
3. Add the necessary dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  parking_widget: ^1.0.0
```

4. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the dependencies.
5. In your desired app screen, import the parking widget:

```dart
import 'package:parking_widget/parking_widget.dart';
```

6. Add the parking widget to your app's layout. You can customize the widget's appearance and behavior according to your app's requirements. Here's an example of how to create a simple reservation button:

```dart
ParkingWidget(
   reservationButton: ReservationButton(
       onPressed: () {
           // Handle reservation button press
       },
       text: 'Reserve Parking',
   ),
),
```

## Customization Options

Flutter's parking widget provides various customization options to match your app's design and functionalities. Here are a few customization options you can explore:

### Availability Display

You can display the available parking spots using `AvailabilityStatus`, which can be either `AvailabilityStatus.available` or `AvailabilityStatus.unavailable`. Use this status along with the `availabilityText` property to show the availability of parking spots.

```dart
ParkingWidget(
   availabilityStatus: AvailabilityStatus.available,
   availabilityText: 'Available',
),
```

### Time and Date Selection

You can add time and date selection functionality to the parking reservation widget by using the `DateTimePicker` widget. This allows users to select their preferred parking duration.

```dart
ParkingWidget(
   reservationButton: ReservationButton(
       onPressed: () {
           // Handle reservation button press
       },
       text: 'Reserve Parking',
   ),
   dateTimePicker: DateTimePicker(
       initialDate: DateTime.now(),
       onDateChanged: (DateTime date) {
           // Handle date selection
       },
       onTimeChanged: (TimeOfDay time) {
           // Handle time selection
       },
   ),
),
```
