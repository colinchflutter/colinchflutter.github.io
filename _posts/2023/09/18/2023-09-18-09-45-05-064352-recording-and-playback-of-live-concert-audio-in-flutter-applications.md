Are you a music lover or an aspiring musician looking to build a Flutter application that allows users to record and playback live concert audio? In this article, we will explore how you can achieve this using Flutter, a popular framework for building cross-platform applications.

## Recording Audio

To record audio in a Flutter application, we can utilize the `audio_recorder` plugin. This plugin provides an API to access the device's microphone and save the recorded audio to a file.

To get started, let's add the `audio_recorder` plugin to our `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  audio_recorder: <latest_version>
```

Next, let's import the necessary libraries in our Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:audio_recorder/audio_recorder.dart';
import 'package:audio_recorder/model/audio_recorder_state.dart';
```

To start recording the audio, we can use the following code snippet:

```dart
void startRecording() async {
  bool hasPermissions = await AudioRecorder.hasPermissions;
  if (hasPermissions) {
    await AudioRecorder.start();
  } else {
    // Request necessary permissions to start recording
    await AudioRecorder.requestPermissions();
    // Start recording after obtaining the necessary permissions
    await AudioRecorder.start();
  }
}
```

The `startRecording` function checks if the application has the necessary permissions and requests them if needed. Once the permissions are granted, it starts the recording.

## Playback Audio

To playback the recorded audio, we can use the `audioplayers` plugin, which provides an API to play both local and remote audio files.

To add the `audioplayers` plugin, include the following in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  audioplayers: <latest_version>
```

Now, import the required libraries in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:audioplayers/audioplayers.dart';
```

To play the audio file, you can use the following code snippet:

```dart
void playAudio(String filePath) async {
  AudioPlayer audioPlayer = AudioPlayer();
  await audioPlayer.play(filePath, isLocal: true);
}
```

Here, the `playAudio` function takes the file path of the recorded audio and plays it locally.

## Wrapping Up

In this article, we explored how to record and playback live concert audio in Flutter applications. We used the `audio_recorder` plugin for recording audio and the `audioplayers` plugin for audio playback. By integrating these plugins into your Flutter application, you can create a seamless experience for users to record and listen to live concert audio.
