Recurring alarms are an essential feature in many mobile applications, allowing you to schedule and trigger tasks at specific intervals or at specified times of the day. With Flutter Alarm Manager, you can easily implement recurring alarms in your Flutter application.

## What is Flutter Alarm Manager?

Flutter Alarm Manager is a plugin that provides a simple and efficient way to schedule and manage alarms in your Flutter application. It supports both one-time and recurring alarms, allowing you to schedule tasks at specific intervals or at specific times.

To get started with Flutter Alarm Manager, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_alarm_manager: ^1.0.0
```

## Scheduling a recurring alarm

To schedule a recurring alarm, you'll need to use the `flutter_alarm_manager` library in combination with the `dart:isolate` library. Here's an example of how to schedule a recurring alarm in your Flutter application:

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_alarm_manager/flutter_alarm_manager.dart';
import 'package:flutter_isolate/flutter_isolate.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // ...

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      // ...
    );
  }
}

void myAlarmCallback() {
  // Perform your recurring task here
  print('Recurring alarm triggered!');
}

void isolateEntry(dynamic message) {
  Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 60), (timer) {
    myAlarmCallback();
  });
}

void scheduleAlarm() async {
  final isolate = await FlutterIsolate.spawn(isolateEntry, null);
  await FlutterAlarmManager.periodic(
    const Duration(seconds: 60), // Set the interval here
    myAlarmCallback,
    options: AlarmOptions(
      wakeup: true,
      alarmClock: true,
    ),
  );
}

```

In the above example, we first define a callback function `myAlarmCallback()` which will be executed each time the alarm is triggered. Inside this function, you can perform the recurring task you want.

Then, we define an `isolateEntry()` function which will run in a separate isolate. This function is responsible for invoking the `myAlarmCallback()` function at the specified interval using the `Timer.periodic()` method.

Finally, we define the `scheduleAlarm()` function which schedules the recurring alarm using `FlutterAlarmManager.periodic()`. The `periodic()` method takes in the interval duration and the callback function as parameters.

Make sure to call the `scheduleAlarm()` function at an appropriate place in your application, such as in the `initState()` method of your root widget.

## Conclusion

By using Flutter Alarm Manager, you can easily implement recurring alarms in your Flutter application. This allows you to schedule and trigger tasks at specific intervals or at specified times of the day. With the code example provided, you can get started with implementing recurring alarms in your Flutter app today!
