In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of building a voice command app using Flutter, a popular cross-platform framework for building mobile applications. The app will allow users to record audio and perform speech recognition tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have Flutter installed on your system. You can follow the official Flutter installation guide for your specific operating system.

## Setting up the Project

1. Create a new Flutter project by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   flutter create voice_command_app
   ```

2. Switch to the project directory:
   ```
   cd voice_command_app
   ```

3. Open the project in your favorite code editor.

## Recording Audio

To record audio in Flutter, we will use the `audioplayers` package. Add the following dependency to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  audioplayers: ^0.18.3
```

Run `flutter pub get` to download and install the package.

Now, let's create a new file called `audio_recorder.dart`. This file will contain the logic for recording audio. 

```dart
import 'package:audioplayers/audioplayers.dart';

class AudioRecorder {
  static Future<String> startRecording() async {
    AudioPlayer audioPlayer = AudioPlayer();
    String filePath = 'path_to_save_audio_file';
    await audioPlayer.startRecord(filePath, codec: Codec.aacADTS);
    return filePath;
  }

  static Future<void> stopRecording() async {
    await AudioPlayer().stopRecord();
  }
}
```

## Speech Recognition

For speech recognition, we will use the `speech_to_text` package in Flutter. Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  speech_to_text: ^5.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to download and install the package.

Create a new file named `speech_recognition.dart` and add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:speech_to_text/speech_recognition_result.dart';
import 'package:speech_to_text/speech_to_text.dart';

class SpeechRecognizer {
  final SpeechToText _speech = SpeechToText();

  bool _isListening = false;
  String _transcription = '';

  bool get isListening => _isListening;
  String get transcription => _transcription;

  Future<bool> initSpeechRecognizer() async {
    bool hasSpeech = await _speech.initialize();
    return hasSpeech;
  }

  void startListening() {
    _speech.listen(
      onResult: (SpeechRecognitionResult result) {
        _transcription = result.recognizedWords;
        // Add your logic here to handle the recognized speech
      },
    );
    _isListening = true;
  }

  void stopListening() {
    _speech.stop();
    _isListening = false;
  }
}
```

## Using the Audio Recorder and Speech Recognizer

Now, let's use the `AudioRecorder` and `SpeechRecognizer` classes in our Flutter app. 

In your main.dart file, modify the `MyApp` class as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:voice_command_app/audio_recorder.dart';
import 'package:voice_command_app/speech_recognition.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final AudioRecorder audioRecorder = AudioRecorder();
  final SpeechRecognizer speechRecognizer = SpeechRecognizer();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      // Add your app UI and logic here
    );
  }
}
```

You now have the necessary components to record audio and perform speech recognition in your Flutter app!

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to build a voice command app using Flutter. We covered the basics of recording audio and performing speech recognition using the `audioplayers` and `speech_to_text` packages. You can now use these concepts to build more advanced voice command features in your app. Happy coding!
