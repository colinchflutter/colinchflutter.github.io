In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate Flutter Alarm Manager with the Google Classroom API to create scheduled reminders for students using a Flutter application. The Alarm Manager plugin will be used to schedule and manage alarms in the application, while the Google Classroom API will handle fetching and updating data from Google Classroom.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

1. Flutter SDK installed on your machine.
2. Basic knowledge of Flutter and Dart programming language.
3. A Google Cloud Platform project with the Classroom API enabled. You will also need the Client ID and Client Secret for OAuth2 authentication.

## Step 1: Set up Flutter Alarm Manager
To use the Flutter Alarm Manager plugin, you need to add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_alarm_manager: ^0.4.5
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter packages get` to update your project.

## Step 2: Authenticate with Google Classroom API
To access the Google Classroom API, you need to authenticate your Flutter application using the OAuth2 flow. Follow these steps:

1. Create a GoogleService class to handle authentication and API requests. Inside the class, create a `GoogleSignIn` object to handle the OAuth2 authentication flow.

```dart
class GoogleService {
  static final signIn = GoogleSignIn(clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID');
  ...
}
```

2. Implement the `signIn` and `signOut` methods to handle authentication.

```dart
class GoogleService {
  static final signIn = GoogleSignIn(clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID');

  static Future<void> signIn() async {
    try {
      await signIn.signIn();
    } catch (error) {
      print('Failed to sign in: $error');
    }
  }

  static Future<void> signOut() async {
    await signIn.signOut();
  }
  
  ...
}
```

3. Use the `google_sign_in` library to authenticate the user.

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      ...
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('My App')),
        body: Center(
          child: RaisedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              await GoogleService.signIn();
              // Continue with Classroom API integration
            },
            child: const Text('Sign in'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Fetch reminders from Google Classroom API
Once the user is authenticated, you can use the Google Classroom API to fetch the student's class data and create reminders.

1. Add the `googleapis` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  googleapis: ^4.0.0
  googleapis_auth: ^0.2.11
```

2. Create a `ClassroomService` class to handle API requests. Initialize the `classroom` object with the authenticated HTTP client.

```dart
class ClassroomService {
  final authClient = GoogleService.signIn.currentUser.authenticatedClient(); 
  final classroom = ClassroomApi(authClient);
  ...
}
```

3. Fetch the student's classes using the `courses.list()` method.

```dart
class ClassroomService {
  final authClient = GoogleService.signIn.currentUser.authenticatedClient();
  final classroom = ClassroomApi(authClient);

  Future<List<Course>> getStudentCourses() async {
    final response = await classroom.courses.list();
    return response.courses;
  }
  
  ...
}
```

## Step 4: Schedule reminders using Flutter Alarm Manager
Now that we have fetched the student's classes, we can use the Flutter Alarm Manager to schedule reminders for each class.

1. Create a `ReminderScheduler` class to manage alarms.

```dart
class ReminderScheduler {
  static void scheduleReminder(DateTime dateTime, String reminderText) async {
    await FlutterAlarmManager.cancelAll();
    await FlutterAlarmManager.periodic(
      const Duration(days: 1), // Schedule alarm to repeat every day
      0, // Alarm ID
      _showReminderNotification,
      startAt: dateTime.subtract(const Duration(hours: 1)), // Schedule alarm 1 hour before class
      rescheduleOnReboot: true,
      exact: true,
      wakeup: true,
    );
  }

  static void _showReminderNotification() {
    // Display notification here
  }
}
```

2. Schedule reminders for each class using the fetched class data.

```dart
class ClassroomService {
  final authClient = GoogleService.signIn.currentUser.authenticatedClient();
  final classroom = ClassroomApi(authClient);

  Future<void> scheduleClassReminders() async {
    final courses = await getStudentCourses();
    courses.forEach((course) {
      final classTime = // Get the class time from course data
      final reminderText = // Generate reminder text based on course data

      ReminderScheduler.scheduleReminder(classTime, reminderText);
    });
  }
  
  ...
}
```

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we explored how to integrate the Flutter Alarm Manager with the Google Classroom API to schedule reminders for students. We covered setting up the Flutter Alarm Manager, authenticating with the Google Classroom API, fetching class data, and scheduling reminders using the Alarm Manager. By following these steps, you can create a seamless experience for students with automated reminders for their Google Classroom classes.
