In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate Flutter Alarm Manager with the FlightAware API to create a reliable alarm system for flight notifications. This integration will allow users to receive timely alerts and reminders before their flights.

## What is Flutter Alarm Manager?

Flutter Alarm Manager is a plugin for Flutter that provides a way to schedule and manage alarms in the Flutter application. With Alarm Manager, developers can schedule one-time or recurring alarms and respond to them even if the app is not running.

## What is FlightAware API?

FlightAware API is a real-time flight tracking and aviation data provider. It offers a wide range of useful functionalities, including flight information, flight status, aircraft tracking, and more. By integrating with the FlightAware API, we can fetch flight details and set up notifications for flight-related events.

## Setting Up the Flutter Project

Before we can integrate Alarm Manager and FlightAware API, let's set up a new Flutter project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
flutter create flutter_alarm_manager_flightaware
```

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory:

```
cd flutter_alarm_manager_flightaware
```

## Installing the Required Packages

To integrate Alarm Manager and FlightAware API in our Flutter application, we need to add the following dependencies to the `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  alarm_manager: ^0.4.3
  http: ^0.13.3
```

After adding these dependencies, run the following command to install them:

```
flutter pub get
```

## Implementing Alarm Manager

Let's start by configuring Flutter Alarm Manager to schedule and manage alarms in our Flutter application. Open the `main.dart` file and add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:alarm_manager/alarm_manager.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Alarm Manager',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {

  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    // Schedule a one-time alarm after 5 seconds
    AlarmManager.oneShot(Duration(seconds: 5), MyAlarmReceiver.alarmCallback);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Alarm Manager'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Alarm scheduled!',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyAlarmReceiver {

  static void alarmCallback() {
    print('Alarm triggered!');
    // Implement your flight notification logic here
  }
}
```

In the code above, we have set up the basic Flutter application structure and scheduled a one-time alarm using Alarm Manager. When the alarm triggers, it will call the `alarmCallback` method in the `MyAlarmReceiver` class. You can replace the print statement in the callback method with your flight notification logic.

## Integrating with FlightAware API

To integrate with the FlightAware API, we need to make HTTP requests to fetch flight details. We will use the `http` package for this purpose.

Let's update the `MyAlarmReceiver` class to fetch flight details from the FlightAware API. Replace the `MyAlarmReceiver` class with the following code:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

class MyAlarmReceiver {

  static void alarmCallback() async {
    print('Alarm triggered! Fetching flight details...');

    final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://flightaware-api-url'));

    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      // Parse flight details from the response
      // Implement your flight notification logic here
    } else {
      print('Failed to fetch flight details.');
    }
  }
}
```

In the code above, replace `'https://flightaware-api-url'` with the actual FlightAware API endpoint to fetch flight details. Once you have the flight details, you can implement your flight notification logic accordingly.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to integrate Flutter Alarm Manager with the FlightAware API to create a reliable alarm system for flight notifications. By using Alarm Manager to schedule alarms and FlightAware API to fetch flight details, we can ensure that users receive timely reminders and alerts before their flights. This integration opens up a world of possibilities for building sophisticated flight tracking and notification applications in Flutter.
