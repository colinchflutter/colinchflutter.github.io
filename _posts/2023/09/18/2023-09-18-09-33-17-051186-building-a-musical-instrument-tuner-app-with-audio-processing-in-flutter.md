In this tutorial, we will guide you on building a musical instrument tuner app using the Flutter framework. Flutter is a powerful and flexible UI toolkit developed by Google, and it enables developers to build beautiful and cross-platform applications.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:
- Flutter SDK: [Installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Android Studio or Visual Studio Code: [Installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor)

## Getting Started
To create a new Flutter app, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```dart
flutter create tuner_app
cd tuner_app
```

Once the project structure is set up, open the project in your preferred IDE. We will be using Visual Studio Code for this tutorial.

## Project Structure
The main file of our app will be `main.dart`. Open it and update it with the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(TunerApp());
}

class TunerApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      title: 'Tuner App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: TunerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class TunerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TunerScreenState createState() => _TunerScreenState();
}

class _TunerScreenState extends State<TunerScreen> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Tuner'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Coming soon...'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Audio Processing
To process audio and implement the tuner functionality, we will use the `audioplayers` and `flutter_sound` packages. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  audioplayers: ^0.17.0
  flutter_sound: ^8.4.0
```

Save the file and run the following command in your terminal to fetch the dependencies:

```dart
flutter pub get
```

## Implementing the Tuner Logic
Now, let's implement the logic for the tuner. We will use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to analyze the audio waveform and determine the pitch.

Add the following code to the `_TunerScreenState` class:

```dart
import 'package:audioplayers/audioplayers.dart';

...

AudioPlayer audioPlayer = AudioPlayer();
double currentPitch = 0.0;

Future<void> playAudio() async {
  await audioPlayer.play('assets/audio/sample_audio.mp3');
}

void analyzeAudio() {
  // Implement audio analysis logic using FFT
  // Update the currentPitch variable with the analyzed pitch
}
```

In the above code, we initialize an `AudioPlayer` and define a `currentPitch` variable to store the analyzed pitch. 

The `playAudio` function plays the sample audio file by providing the path to the audio file. Update the file path as per your own audio.

The `analyzeAudio` function is where you will implement the audio analysis logic using the FFT algorithm. This function will update the `currentPitch` value with the analyzed pitch.

Now, let's update the UI to display the current pitch. Replace the `body` property of the `TunerScreen` widget with the following code:

```dart
body: Column(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
  children: [
    Text(
      'Current Pitch:',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 20,
        fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
      ),
    ),
    SizedBox(height: 10),
    Text(
      '$currentPitch Hz',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 24,
        fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
        color: Colors.green,
      ),
    ),
    SizedBox(height: 30),
    ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: playAudio,
      child: Text('Play Audio'),
    ),
  ],
),
```

The above code adds two `Text` widgets to display the current pitch value. The `ElevatedButton` is used to trigger the `playAudio` function.

## Testing the App
To test the app, run the following command in your terminal:

```dart
flutter run
```

This will launch the app on your connected device or emulator. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the "Tuner" app with the "Play Audio" button. Press the button to hear the audio and see the current pitch value displayed.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have covered the basic steps to build a musical instrument tuner app using Flutter. We implemented the audio processing logic using the FFT algorithm and displayed the current pitch value on the screen. Now, you can further enhance the app by adding more features and improving the UI.
