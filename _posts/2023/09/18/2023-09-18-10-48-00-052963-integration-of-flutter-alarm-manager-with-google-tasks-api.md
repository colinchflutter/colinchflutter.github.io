In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate the **Flutter Alarm Manager** package with the **Google Tasks API**. This integration will allow you to set alarms in your Flutter application based on the tasks from the Google Tasks API.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

1. A Flutter application set up on your development environment.
2. A Google Cloud project with the **Tasks API** enabled.

## Step 1: Set Up the Flutter Alarm Manager Package
To get started, add the **flutter_alarm_manager** package to your Flutter project. Open your project's `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```
dependencies:
  flutter_alarm_manager: ^1.0.0
```

Save the file and run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package into your project.

## Step 2: Authenticate with the Google Tasks API
Next, you'll need to authenticate your Flutter application with the Google Tasks API. Follow these steps:

1. Create an OAuth 2.0 client ID credential for your project in the Google Cloud Console.
2. Download the JSON file containing the client ID and client secret.
3. Add the JSON file to your Flutter project's root directory.

## Step 3: Set Up the Alarm Manager
Now, let's set up the alarm manager in your Flutter application. Import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_alarm_manager/flutter_alarm_manager.dart';
import 'package:google_tasks_api/google_tasks_api.dart';
```

Create an instance of the `GoogleTasksApi` class and authenticate using the JSON file you downloaded:

```dart
final googleTasksApi = GoogleTasksApi(jsonAuth: 'path_to_json_file.json');
await googleTasksApi.login();
```

## Step 4: Fetch Tasks from Google Tasks API
To fetch tasks from the Google Tasks API, use the `getTasks()` method:

```dart
final tasks = await googleTasksApi.getTasks();
```

## Step 5: Set Alarms for Tasks
Now that we have the tasks, let's set up alarms for them using the `flutter_alarm_manager` package. Iterate through the list of tasks and use the `AlarmManager` class to set the alarms:

```dart
final alarmManager = AlarmManager();

for (var task in tasks) {
  final time = ...; // Get the time for the alarm from the task
  final alarmId = ...; // Generate an ID for the alarm

  final alarmInfo = AlarmInfo(alarmId, time, 'Alarm for task: ${task.title}');
  alarmManager.setAlarm(alarmInfo);
}
```

## Conclusion
By integrating the **Flutter Alarm Manager** package with the **Google Tasks API**, you can create a seamless experience for your users by setting alarms based on their Google Tasks. This integration can be particularly useful for productivity applications and reminders.

Make sure to check out the official documentation for both packages to explore more features and options.
