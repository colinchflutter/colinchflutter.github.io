In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a music transcription app using Flutter, a popular cross-platform framework for building mobile and web applications. Our app will allow users to record audio, transcribe the music into sheet music notation, and generate a sheet music view.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Flutter and Dart programming language
- Flutter SDK installed on your machine
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Android Studio)

## Getting Started
Let's start by creating a new Flutter project using the Flutter CLI tool:

```shell
flutter create music_transcription_app
cd music_transcription_app
```

## Recording Audio
To capture audio input from the device's microphone, we can use the `audioplayers` package. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  audioplayers: ^0.20.0
```

Next, import the package in your Dart file and implement the audio recording functionality:

```dart
import 'package:audioplayers/audioplayers.dart';

class AudioRecorder {
  AudioPlayer _audioPlayer;

  Future<void> startRecording() async {
    // Code to start audio recording
  }

  Future<void> stopRecording() async {
    // Code to stop audio recording
  }
}
```

## Transcribing Music
For music transcription, we can leverage existing libraries such as `aubio` or `librosa` to analyze the recorded audio and extract note information. These libraries often have bindings available that can be used in Dart or Flutter.

```dart
import 'package:aubio/aubio.dart';

class MusicTranscriber {
  Aubio _aubio;

  Future<void> transcribeAudio(String audioFilePath) async {
    // Code to load audio and transcribe music
  }

  List<double> extractNotes() {
    // Code to extract note information
  }
}
```

## Sheet Music Generation
To generate sheet music from the extracted notes, we can utilize libraries like `vexflow` or `music21`. These libraries allow us to create musical notation in various formats such as MusicXML or SVG.

```dart
import 'package:vexflow/vexflow.dart';

class SheetMusicGenerator {
  VexFlow _vexFlow;

  void generateSheetMusic(List<double> notes) {
    // Code to generate sheet music
  }

  void renderSheetMusic() {
    // Code to render sheet music view
  }
}
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored building a music transcription app using Flutter. We covered audio recording, music transcription, and sheet music generation. With these foundational components in place, you can expand the app's features to provide a seamless and interactive music transcription experience.

Remember to pay attention to additional packages, libraries, and APIs that can enhance your app's functionality and user experience. Feel free to experiment with different styles and customization options to make your music transcription app stand out.
