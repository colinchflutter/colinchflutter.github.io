## Introduction
One of the key advantages of using Flutter for app development is its ability to build apps for multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and web. However, maintaining separate codebases for each platform can be time-consuming and complex. This is where multi-platform code sharing frameworks come into play. In this blog post, we will explore some popular frameworks that enable sharing code across multiple platforms in Flutter.

## 1. Riverpod
[Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) is a state management library inspired by Provider, but with improved features and performance. It allows you to share your business logic and state management code across different platforms and easily integrate it into your Flutter apps. With Riverpod, you can achieve code reuse and maintainability by writing your core logic once and using it across various platforms.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

final counterProvider = Provider<int>((_) => 0);

class MyHomePage extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, ScopedReader watch) {
    final count = watch(counterProvider);
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Riverpod Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Count: $count',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () => context.read(counterProvider).state++,
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## 2. Flutter Hooks
[Flutter Hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks) is a lightweight framework that provides hooks, inspired by the React Hooks API, for sharing and reusing stateful logic in Flutter. With Flutter Hooks, you can extract and share complex logic across different platforms without the need for separate codebases. Hooks allow you to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic in a concise and modular way.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_hooks/flutter_hooks.dart';

class CounterExample extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final count = useState(0);
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flutter Hooks Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Count: ${count.value}',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () => count.value++,
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Conclusion
Multi-platform code sharing frameworks like Riverpod and Flutter Hooks offer powerful solutions for reducing code duplication and improving code sharing in Flutter apps. By leveraging these frameworks, developers can write code once and reuse it across multiple platforms, leading to increased productivity and maintainability. Give them a try and see how they can streamline your Flutter development process. #Flutter #CodeSharingFrameworks
