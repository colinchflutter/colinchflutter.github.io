In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a study tracker app with alarm functionality using Flutter. This app will help students track their study sessions and set reminders for their study time.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can check if Flutter is installed by running the following command:

```
flutter doctor
```

If Flutter is not installed, please follow the official Flutter installation guide for your operating system.

## Setting up the Project

To create a new Flutter project, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
flutter create study_tracker
```

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory:

```
cd study_tracker
```

## Designing the User Interface

For this app, we'll keep the UI simple. We'll have a main screen to display the study sessions and a form screen to add a new study session. You can design the UI according to your preference, or follow along with the code provided.

### Main Screen

In the `lib` directory, create a new file called `main_screen.dart`. In this file, we'll define the main screen UI.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MainScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Study Tracker'),
      ),
      body: Container(
        // Add your UI components here
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Form Screen

In the `lib` directory, create another file called `form_screen.dart`. In this file, we'll define the form screen UI.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class FormScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Add Study Session'),
      ),
      body: Container(
        // Add your UI components here
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Adding Alarm Functionality

To implement the alarm functionality, we'll use the `flutter_local_notifications` package. Add the package dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_local_notifications: ^1.5.0
  // ... other dependencies
```

Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

### Setting up Alarm Notifications

In the `lib` directory, create a new file called `alarm_service.dart`. In this file, we'll define a class that handles setting up and triggering the alarm notifications.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_local_notifications/flutter_local_notifications.dart';

class AlarmService {
  FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin;

  Future<void> initialize() async {
    flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin = FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin();
    
    const initializationSettings = InitializationSettings(
      // Configure your initialization settings here
    );
    
    await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.initialize(initializationSettings);
  }

  Future<void> scheduleAlarm(DateTime scheduledTime) async {
    const androidPlatformChannelSpecifics = AndroidNotificationDetails(
      'channel_id',
      'channel_name',
      'channel_description',
    );
    
    const platformChannelSpecifics =
        NotificationDetails(android: androidPlatformChannelSpecifics);
    
    await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.schedule(
      0,
      'Study Reminder',
      'Time to Study!',
      scheduledTime,
      platformChannelSpecifics,
    );
  }
}
```

### Using the Alarm Service

In the `form_screen.dart` file, let's integrate the alarm functionality into the form submission.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'alarm_service.dart';

class FormScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final _alarmService = AlarmService();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // ...
    
    void _submitForm() async {
      // Add your form submission logic here
      DateTime scheduledTime = // ... Parse the scheduled time from the form
      
      await _alarmService.initialize();
      await _alarmService.scheduleAlarm(scheduledTime);
      
      Navigator.pop(context);
    }
    
    return Scaffold(
      // ...
    );
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to build a study tracker app with alarm functionality using Flutter. We covered designing the user interface and integrating alarm notifications using the `flutter_local_notifications` package. You can now customize and extend the app based on your requirements.
