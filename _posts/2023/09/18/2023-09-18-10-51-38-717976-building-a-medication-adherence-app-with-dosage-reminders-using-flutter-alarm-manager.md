Medication non-adherence is a common problem that can have serious consequences for patients' health. One way to address this issue is by building a medication adherence app that provides dosage reminders to users. In this tutorial, we will explore how to build such an app using Flutter Alarm Manager.

## What is Flutter Alarm Manager?

Flutter Alarm Manager is a Flutter plugin that allows you to schedule and manage alarms on Android and iOS devices. It provides a convenient way to set up periodic or one-time alarms and execute tasks at specific times.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. If not, head over to the official Flutter website and follow the installation instructions.

Next, create a new Flutter project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter create medication_adherence_app
```

## Setting up the Flutter Alarm Manager Plugin

To use the Flutter Alarm Manager plugin, you need to add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the file and add the following code:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_alarm_manager: ^0.4.6
```

Save the file and run the following command to fetch the plugin:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Implementing Dosage Reminders

Now, let's start implementing the dosage reminders feature in our medication adherence app. 

First, we need to import the necessary dependencies. Open the `main.dart` file and add the following imports:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_alarm_manager/flutter_alarm_manager.dart';
```

Next, add a function to schedule the dosage reminders. This function will be called when the user sets up their medication schedule. In this example, let's assume that the user selects a specific time and frequency for reminders:

```dart
void scheduleDosageReminder(DateTime time, int frequency) async {
  for (int i = 0; i < frequency; i++) {
    DateTime reminderTime = time.add(Duration(days: i));
    await FlutterAlarmManager.schedule(
      id: i,
      dateTime: reminderTime,
      callback: dosageReminderCallback,
      alarmType: AlarmType.RTC_WAKEUP,
      repeatInterval: Interval.daily,
    );
  }
}
```

In the `scheduleDosageReminder` function, we iterate over the selected frequency and schedule alarms using Flutter Alarm Manager's `schedule` method. We pass the reminder time, a callback function (`dosageReminderCallback`), and other necessary parameters like the alarm type and repeat interval.

Now, let's write the `dosageReminderCallback` function that will be triggered when a dosage reminder alarm fires:

```dart
void dosageReminderCallback() {
  // Show a notification, play a sound, or perform any desired action
  // to remind the user to take their medication.
}
```

Inside the `dosageReminderCallback` function, you can implement actions like showing a notification, playing a sound, or any other desired reminder mechanism.

To test our implementation, let's add a simple button that triggers the `scheduleDosageReminder` function when pressed. We'll set the reminder time to the current time and the frequency to 3:

```dart
FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: () {
    DateTime reminderTime = DateTime.now();
    int frequency = 3;
    scheduleDosageReminder(reminderTime, frequency);
  },
  child: Icon(Icons.add),
),
```

When the user taps on this button, dosage reminders will be scheduled for the current time and will repeat three times at daily intervals.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to build a medication adherence app with dosage reminders using the Flutter Alarm Manager plugin. We learned how to set up the plugin, schedule dosage reminders, and handle reminder callbacks. With this knowledge, you can now enhance your medication adherence app by incorporating dosage reminders to help users stay on track with their medication schedule.
