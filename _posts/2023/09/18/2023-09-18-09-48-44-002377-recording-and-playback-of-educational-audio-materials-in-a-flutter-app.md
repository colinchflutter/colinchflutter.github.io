Flutter, the popular cross-platform framework developed by Google, provides developers with the ability to build beautiful and high-performing mobile applications. With its rich set of tools and widgets, Flutter offers an excellent platform to create educational apps that can engage and inspire learners.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to incorporate audio recording and playback functionality into a Flutter app for educational purposes. We'll showcase a simple example where users can record their voice and listen to it later.

## Setting Up the Project

Before we begin, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. If not, head over to the official Flutter website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Once Flutter is set up, create a new Flutter project using the following command:

```
flutter create audio_app
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd audio_app
```

## Adding Dependencies

To enable audio recording and playback, we need to add the `audioplayers` package to our project. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  audioplayers: ^0.19.2
```

Run `flutter pub get` to download the package and add it to your project.

## Implementing Recording and Playback

### Recording

First, let's create a new screen in our app that will allow users to record their voice. Create a new file `record_screen.dart` and add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:audioplayers/audioplayers.dart';

class RecordScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RecordScreenState createState() => _RecordScreenState();
}

class _RecordScreenState extends State<RecordScreen> {
  AudioPlayer _audioPlayer = AudioPlayer();
  String _recordPath;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _audioPlayer.onPlayerCompletion.listen((event) {
      _playRecordedAudio();
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _audioPlayer.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  Future<void> _startRecording() async {
    // Implement audio recording logic here
    // Store the recorded audio file path in _recordPath variable
  }

  Future<void> _stopRecording() async {
    // Implement audio stop recording logic here
  }

  Future<void> _playRecordedAudio() async {
    await _audioPlayer.play(_recordPath, isLocal: true);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Record Audio'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            RaisedButton(
              onPressed: _startRecording,
              child: Text('Start Recording'),
            ),
            RaisedButton(
              onPressed: _stopRecording,
              child: Text('Stop Recording'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up the basic structure of the `RecordScreen` widget. It includes functionality to start and stop audio recording using placeholders `_startRecording()` and `_stopRecording()`. We also utilize the `audioplayers` package to handle audio playback.

### Playback

To build the playback feature, add another file called `playback_screen.dart` and include the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:audioplayers/audioplayers.dart';

class PlaybackScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  final String recordPath;

  PlaybackScreen({this.recordPath});

  @override
  _PlaybackScreenState createState() => _PlaybackScreenState();
}

class _PlaybackScreenState extends State<PlaybackScreen> {
  AudioPlayer _audioPlayer = AudioPlayer();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _playRecordedAudio();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _audioPlayer.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  Future<void> _playRecordedAudio() async {
    await _audioPlayer.play(widget.recordPath, isLocal: true);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Playback Audio'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: RaisedButton(
          onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
          child: Text('Go Back'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, we create the `PlaybackScreen` widget, which takes the `recordPath` as a parameter and plays the recorded audio when initialized. A simple "Go Back" button is also included to navigate back to the previous screen.

## Integrating Recording and Playback into App

Now, we need to wire up the recording and playback screens in our main app. Open the `main.dart` file and replace the existing code with the code below:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'record_screen.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(AudioApp());
}

class AudioApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Audio App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: RecordScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, we set `RecordScreen` as the initial screen of our app. 

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented audio recording and playback functionality in your Flutter app. We've covered the basics of incorporating this feature into your educational app, allowing users to record their voice and listen to it later.

Feel free to enhance this functionality by adding more features like audio trimming, saving recordings to local storage, or implementing a list of recorded audio files.

Remember to thoroughly test your app on various devices and simulate different scenarios to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience.

Happy coding!
