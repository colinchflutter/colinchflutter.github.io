## Introduction
One of the key advantages of using Flutter for app development is its ability to share code across different platforms. With Flutter, you can write a single codebase and deploy it on both iOS and Android platforms. However, there are times when you need to write platform-specific code to achieve certain functionalities or customize the app's behavior on a specific platform. In this blog post, we will explore how to share code across platforms in Flutter and how to write platform-specific code when needed.

## Cross-Platform Code Sharing
Flutter follows a "write once, run anywhere" principle, allowing developers to write code that works on multiple platforms. Common UI components, logic, and business rules can be shared across iOS and Android. To achieve cross-platform code sharing in Flutter:

1. **Create a new Flutter project**: Start by creating a new Flutter project using the Flutter CLI or your preferred IDE.

2. **Create a shared codebase**: The core logic of your app, such as data models, business logic, and utility functions, should be placed in a shared codebase. Create a separate directory in your Flutter project for shared code and organize files accordingly.

3. **Use package dependencies**: Utilize existing package dependencies from the Flutter ecosystem to avoid reinventing the wheel. Packages like provider, http, and shared_preferences can be used in both iOS and Android code.

4. **Follow platform-agnostic APIs**: While writing shared code, it's crucial to use platform-agnostic APIs provided by Flutter. These APIs ensure that the functionality you implement works consistently across different platforms.

## Platform-Specific Code
Despite Flutter's cross-platform capabilities, there may be situations where you need to write platform-specific code. This could be due to a platform limitation, desired native behavior, or leveraging platform-specific APIs. Flutter provides mechanisms to handle platform-specific code effectively:

1. **Conditional compilation**: Flutter allows you to conditionally compile code based on the platform using the `dart:io` library. For example, you can use `Platform.isIOS` or `Platform.isAndroid` to execute specific code blocks on iOS or Android, respectively.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
   import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
   import 'dart:io';

   void main() {
     if (Platform.isIOS) {
       // iOS specific code
       runApp(IOSApp());
     } else if (Platform.isAndroid) {
       // Android specific code
       runApp(AndroidApp());
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Platform channels**: Flutter provides a platform channels API that allows communication between Flutter and platform-specific code. This enables you to access native functionalities or call platform-specific APIs through a channel defined in shared code.

3. **Plugins**: When platform-specific functionalities are required, Flutter offers a vast collection of plugins. These plugins act as bridges between Flutter and native platform code, making it easy to integrate platform-specific features seamlessly.

## Conclusion
Flutter provides an excellent environment for sharing code across multiple platforms while offering flexibility for handling platform-specific code when necessary. By leveraging the cross-platform capabilities and wisely incorporating platform-specific code, developers can build high-quality apps that provide a native-like experience on both iOS and Android platforms.
