In today's digital age, live events are becoming increasingly popular, and the need to record and playback audio from these events is a common requirement. With Flutter, a cross-platform development framework, you can easily incorporate audio recording and playback functionality into your application. In this article, we will explore how to achieve this using Flutter's audio plugins.

## Getting Started

Before we begin, make sure you have Flutter set up on your machine. If you haven't installed Flutter yet, follow the installation guide available on the official Flutter website.

## Recording Audio

To record audio in a Flutter application, we can leverage the "audio_recorder" plugin. Start by adding the plugin to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  audio_recorder: ^2.0.0
```

Next, run the following command in your terminal to fetch the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Now, let's create a function to initiate the audio recording process:

```dart
import 'package:audio_recorder/audio_recorder.dart';

void startRecording() async {
  if (await AudioRecorder.hasPermissions) {
    await AudioRecorder.start();
  } else {
    // Handle permissions not granted
  }
}
```

Once you have initiated the recording, you can specify the file to save the recorded audio to. The audio_recorder plugin provides various options to customize the recording, such as audio format and quality.

## Playback Audio

To playback the recorded audio in your Flutter application, you can utilize the "audioplayers" plugin. Add the plugin to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  audioplayers: ^0.18.0
```

Fetch the package:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Now, let's create a function to playback the recorded audio file:

```dart
import 'package:audioplayers/audioplayers.dart';

void playRecording(String filePath) {
  AudioPlayer audioPlayer = AudioPlayer();
  audioPlayer.play(filePath, isLocal: true);
}
```

In this code snippet, we create an instance of the `AudioPlayer` and use the `play` method to start playing the recorded audio. Make sure to provide the correct file path as an argument to the `play` method.

## Conclusion

With Flutter's audio plugins, recording and playback of live event audio in your application is a breeze. By integrating the "audio_recorder" and "audioplayers" plugins, you can achieve a seamless audio recording and playback experience.
