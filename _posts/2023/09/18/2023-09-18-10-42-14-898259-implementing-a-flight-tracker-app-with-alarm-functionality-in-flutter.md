With the increasing popularity of air travel, having a flight tracker app can be a useful tool for avid travelers. In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a flight tracker app using Flutter, a popular cross-platform framework for building mobile applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have Flutter [installed](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) on your machine. Also, ensure that you have set up an emulator or have a physical device connected for running the app.

## Setting up the Project

Start by creating a new Flutter project using the following command:

```bash
flutter create flight_tracker_app
cd flight_tracker_app
```

## Designing the App UI

The first step is to design the app UI. We will use the Flutter Material design widgets to create a modern and visually appealing layout. You can customize the UI as per your requirements, but here's an example to get you started:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class FlightTrackerApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flight Tracker',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity,
      ),
      home: FlightTrackerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class FlightTrackerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FlightTrackerScreenState createState() => _FlightTrackerScreenState();
}

class _FlightTrackerScreenState extends State<FlightTrackerScreen> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flight Tracker'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Flight Tracker Body'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(FlightTrackerApp());
}
```

Save this code in the `lib/main.dart` file of your Flutter project.

## Integrating Flight Tracking API

To track flights, we will integrate a flight tracking API into our app. There are various third-party APIs available that provide flight tracking data. You can choose the one that suits your needs.

Once you have the API credentials, you can use a networking package like `http` or `dio` to make HTTP requests and fetch flight data from the API.

Here's an example of making a network request to fetch flight data:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<String> fetchFlightData() async {
  final response = await http.get('https://api.flighttracker.com/flights');
  
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    return response.body;
  } else {
    throw Exception('Failed to fetch flight data.');
  }
}
```

You can modify this code according to the API documentation and data format.

## Implementing Alarm Functionality

To add alarm functionality, we can use the `flutter_local_notifications` package. This package allows us to schedule and display notifications at specific times.

Here's an example of scheduling a notification:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_local_notifications/flutter_local_notifications.dart';

Future<void> scheduleNotification() async {
  var flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin = FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin();
  
  const AndroidNotificationDetails androidPlatformChannelSpecifics =
    AndroidNotificationDetails('channel_id', 'channel_name', 'channel_description',
        importance: Importance.max, priority: Priority.high);
        
  const NotificationDetails platformChannelSpecifics =
    NotificationDetails(android: androidPlatformChannelSpecifics);
    
  await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.zonedSchedule(
    0, 'Flight Reminder', 'Your flight is about to depart!', scheduledTime, 
    platformChannelSpecifics,
    payload: 'flight_reminder',
    uiLocalNotificationDateInterpretation: UILocalNotificationDateInterpretation.absoluteTime);
}
```

Make sure you modify the notification text and details as per your app requirements.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to implement a flight tracker app with alarm functionality using Flutter. We explored designing the UI, integrating a flight tracking API, and adding alarm notifications.

Remember to [optimize](https://www.example.com/blog/some-seo-tips) your app for performance and consider adding additional features like real-time flight tracking and user authentication to enhance the user experience.
