In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a water intake tracker app with alarm notifications using the Flutter framework. The app will help users track their daily water intake and remind them to drink water at regular intervals.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:
- Flutter SDK installed on your system
- Dart programming language knowledge
- Basic understanding of Flutter widgets and state management

## Steps to Build the App

### Step 1: Create a New Flutter Project
Let's start by creating a new Flutter project using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
flutter create water_intake_tracker_app
```

### Step 2: Define the App UI
Next, let's define the app's user interface using Flutter's widgets. We will create a form to enter the amount of water intake and display a list of entries with the amount and time.

### Step 3: Add Storage Support
In this step, we will add storage support to store the water intake data using a local database such as SQLite or shared preferences.

### Step 4: Implement Alarm Notifications
To notify the user to drink water at regular intervals, we will implement alarm notifications using the Flutter Local Notifications plugin. This will allow us to schedule and trigger notifications based on the user's preferred time intervals.

### Step 5: Test and Deploy
Finally, we will test the app on different devices and platforms to ensure everything works as expected. Once we are satisfied with the app's functionality, we can deploy it to app stores like Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

## Conclusion
Building a water intake tracker app with alarm notifications in Flutter is a great way to learn and explore the capabilities of the Flutter framework. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you will be able to create an app that helps users track their daily water intake and reminds them to stay hydrated.
