Flutter Package Manager is a powerful tool that helps manage dependencies and packages in Flutter projects. It provides a seamless way to install, update, and remove packages from your project. In addition to managing packages, Flutter Package Manager also offers the ability to run unit tests specific to a package.

## Running package-specific unit tests

To run unit tests for a specific package using Flutter Package Manager, follow the steps below:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your Flutter project.

2. Install the desired package if you haven't already done so by using the `fpm install` command. For example, to install the `test` package, run:

   ```
   fpm install test
   ```

3. Once the package is installed, you can now run its unit tests. Use the `fpm test` command followed by the package name. For example, to run the unit tests for the `test` package, run:

   ```
   fpm test test
   ```

   This command will locate the package's tests folder and execute all the tests within it.

4. Flutter Package Manager will provide detailed output on the test results, informing you if any tests have failed or if all tests have passed successfully.

## Summary

Flutter Package Manager not only simplifies package management in Flutter projects but also provides the capability to run package-specific unit tests. This feature enables developers to easily test individual packages and ensure their functionality is not compromised during development or updates.
