## Using pip (Python)

To install a specific version of a package using pip, you can use the following command:
```python
pip install package_name==version_number
```
For example, to install version 1.2.3 of the `numpy` package, you would run:
```python
pip install numpy==1.2.3
```

## Using npm (Node.js)

To install a specific version of a package using npm, you can use the following command:
```javascript
npm install package_name@version_number
```
For example, to install version 2.1.0 of the `express` package, you would run:
```javascript
npm install express@2.1.0
```

## Using gem (Ruby)

To install a specific version of a gem using gem, you can use the following command:
```ruby
gem install gem_name -v version_number
```
For example, to install version 1.0.0 of the `sinatra` gem, you would run:
```ruby
gem install sinatra -v 1.0.0
```

## Using Composer (PHP)

To install a specific version of a package using Composer, you can specify the version in your `composer.json` file. Add the package name and version number to the `require` section, as shown below:
```json
{
    "require": {
        "package_name": "version_number"
    }
}
```
For example, to install version 2.3.4 of the `twig/twig` package, add the following to your `composer.json` file:
```json
{
    "require": {
        "twig/twig": "2.3.4"
    }
}
```
After updating your `composer.json`, run the following command to install the specific package version:
```shell
composer install
```
