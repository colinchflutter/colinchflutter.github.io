As a Flutter developer, you likely rely on various packages to enhance your app's functionality. However, it's essential to keep track of the licenses of these packages and ensure compliance with their terms. In this blog post, we will explore how to manage package licenses efficiently using the **Flutter Package Manager**.

## What is Flutter Package Manager?
Flutter Package Manager is a command-line tool that simplifies the management of dependencies and package licenses in a Flutter project. It helps you to track the licenses of the packages you use, generate a license summary, and ensure compliance with open-source licenses.

## Getting Started
To get started with Flutter Package Manager, you first need to install it globally on your machine. Open your command-line interface and run the following command:

```bash
pub global activate flutter_package_manager
```

Make sure to have Dart and Flutter SDK installed before running this command.

## Tracking Package Licenses
Once you have Flutter Package Manager installed, you can use it to track the licenses of the packages in your Flutter project. Navigate to your project's root directory in the command-line interface and run the following command:

```bash
flutterpubstats --license
```

This command will analyze your pubspec.yaml file, fetch the license information for each package, and generate a summary of the licenses used in your project. The license summary generated by Flutter Package Manager will provide details such as the package name, version, and license type. This summary can be helpful for auditing purposes or ensuring compliance with specific license requirements.

## Updating Package Licenses
Periodically, it's essential to update the licenses of the packages in your project as new versions are released. With Flutter Package Manager, you can easily update the license information in your project. Run the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
flutterpubstats --update-license
```

This command will update the licenses for all the packages in your project based on the latest version information available. It ensures that you have accurate and up-to-date license information for all your dependencies.

## Exporting License Summary
To export the license summary generated by Flutter Package Manager, use the following command:

```bash
flutterpubstats --export-license <file-path>
```

Replace `<file-path>` with the desired file name and directory. This command will generate a license summary in CSV format at the specified location.

## Conclusion
Managing package licenses is a crucial aspect of developing Flutter applications. The Flutter Package Manager simplifies this process by providing tools to track, update, and export package license information. By utilizing this tool, you can ensure compliance with open-source licenses and maintain proper documentation for your app's dependencies.
