## Introduction

As a developer working with Flutter, you may encounter situations where you need to use specific package versions depending on the Flutter version you are targeting. However, managing different package versions manually can be a tedious and error-prone process. That's where **Flutter Package Manager** comes to the rescue. 

In this article, we will explore how to use Flutter Package Manager to compile packages for different Flutter versions with ease. 

## What is Flutter Package Manager?

**Flutter Package Manager** is a powerful command-line tool that allows you to manage different package versions effortlessly. It provides a convenient way to specify version constraints, resolve package dependencies, and compile packages for specific Flutter versions.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Follow the steps below to compile packages for different Flutter versions using Flutter Package Manager:

1. **Install Flutter Package Manager:** Start by installing Flutter Package Manager by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
$ pub global activate fpm
```

2. **Specify Flutter Version Constraint:** In your project's `pubspec.yaml` file, specify the desired Flutter version constraint by adding the following line:

```yaml
environment:
    sdk: ">=2.12.0-0 <3.0.0"
```

This example sets the Flutter version constraint to be >=2.12.0-0 and <3.0.0. Adjust it according to your project's requirements.

3. **Update Package Dependencies:** Run the following command to update your project's dependencies:

```shell
$ flutter pub get
```

This will fetch the latest compatible versions of your packages based on the specified Flutter version constraint.

4. **Compile Packages for Specific Flutter Version:** To compile packages for a specific Flutter version, you can use the `build` command along with the desired Flutter version. For example:

```shell
$ fpm build flutter-sdk:2.5.0
```

This command will compile the packages using Flutter SDK version 2.5.0.

5. **Use Compiled Packages:** After successfully compiling the packages, you can use them in your Flutter project by importing them as usual.

## Conclusion

Managing package versions for different Flutter versions can be a challenging task, but with Flutter Package Manager, it becomes much more manageable. By following this guide, you can easily compile packages for specific Flutter versions and avoid version conflicts and compatibility issues.
