Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that allows developers to automate the building, testing, and deployment of their code changes. CI helps ensure that the codebase is always in a releasable state and reduces the risk of introducing bugs or breaking changes. In this blog post, we will explore how to set up CI for a Flutter project using Flutter Package Manager. 

## What is Flutter Package Manager?

Flutter Package Manager is a command-line tool that helps with maintaining and organizing the dependencies of your Flutter project. It simplifies the process of managing packages and ensures that all team members are using the same versions of dependencies. Flutter Package Manager can also generate a `pubspec.lock` file, which locks the versions of the packages used in your project, guaranteeing consistency across different environments.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up CI with Flutter Package Manager, make sure you have the following:

- A Flutter project with a [pubspec.yaml](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec) file that defines the dependencies.
- A version control system, such as Git, set up to host your code repository.
- A continuous integration service, such as Travis CI, configured for your repository.

## Setting up Continuous Integration

1. Start by creating a file named `.travis.yml` in the root directory of your Flutter project.
2. Open the `.travis.yml` file in a text editor and add the following lines:

```yaml
language: dart

before_install:
  - sudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6  # Required for running Flutter and Dart tests

install:
  - git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable --depth 1
  - export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
  - flutter doctor
  
script:
  - flutter packages get
  - flutter analyze
  - flutter test
```

3. Save the file and commit it to your Git repository.

## Explanation

- The `language: dart` line tells Travis CI that this project uses Dart for the test script.
- The `before_install` step installs the necessary package `lib32stdc++6`, which is required for running Flutter and Dart tests on the Travis CI environment.
- The `install` step clones the stable version of Flutter and adds its binary path to the system `PATH` variable. It then uses `flutter doctor` to check that everything is correctly set up.
- The `script` step runs the necessary commands for CI. It first retrieves the project's dependencies using `flutter packages get`, then performs static analysis with `flutter analyze`, and finally runs the tests with `flutter test`.

## Configuring Travis CI

1. Go to [travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com/) and sign in with your GitHub account.
2. Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner and select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.
3. Scroll down to the "Repositories" section and toggle the switch next to your Flutter project to enable Travis CI for that repository.
4. Click on the "Manage repositories on GitHub" link to access your repository's settings on GitHub.
5. Under the "Integrations & services" tab, search for "Travis CI" and click on the Travis CI service.
6. In the "Environment Variables" section, add an environment variable named `FLUTTER_TOKEN`, and set its value to your Flutter Package Manager token. This token is needed to fetch the dependencies securely.

## Conclusion

Setting up continuous integration for your Flutter project using Flutter Package Manager and Travis CI can significantly improve your development workflow. With CI in place, you can rest assured that your codebase remains reliable and consistent across different environments. By automating the building, testing, and deployment process, you can catch bugs early and deploy updates with confidence.
