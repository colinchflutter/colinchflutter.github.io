If you are developing a Flutter application and want to package it for distribution, one of the easiest ways is to use the **Flutter Package Manager**. This tool allows you to create a package that can be installed and run on different devices without having to go through the traditional app store submission process. In this blog post, we will walk you through the steps of packaging your Flutter application using Flutter Package Manager. 

## Step 1: Setting up Flutter Package Manager

Before you can start packaging your Flutter application, you need to have the **Flutter Package Manager** installed on your machine. This can be done by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
$ flutter pub global activate fpm
```

Once the package manager is installed, you can verify that it was installed correctly by running:

```shell
$ fpm --version
```

Make note of the version number that is displayed, as this will confirm that the installation was successful.

## Step 2: Creating a Package

To create a package for your Flutter application, navigate to the root directory of your project in your terminal. Once there, run the following command:

```shell
$ fpm init
```

This command will generate a `pubspec.yaml` file with the necessary package metadata.

## Step 3: Configuring the Package

Open the `pubspec.yaml` file generated in the previous step in a text editor. Here, you can configure various options such as the package name, version, dependencies, and other metadata about your application.

Make sure to specify the entry point of your application by adding the following line under the `flutter` section:

```yaml
flutter:
  main: <path_to_your_main.dart>
```

Replace `<path_to_your_main.dart>` with the relative path to the main Dart file of your application.

## Step 4: Building the Package

To build the package, run the following command from the root directory of your project:

```shell
$ fpm build
```

The package will be built and stored in the `build` directory of your project.

## Step 5: Distributing the Package

Once the package is built, you can distribute it to different platforms and devices. For example, on Android, you can distribute the package using a tool like [**adb**](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) by running the following command:

```shell
$ adb install build/app.apk
```

Replace `build/app.apk` with the path to the generated APK file.

## Conclusion

The Flutter Package Manager provides a streamlined way to package your Flutter applications and distribute them without the need for traditional app store submission processes. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you should be able to package your Flutter application with ease and distribute it to different platforms and devices.
