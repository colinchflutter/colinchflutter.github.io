In today's interconnected world, network latency can significantly impact the performance of web applications. When building Flutter web apps, it is crucial to keep network requests to a minimum to reduce latency and enhance the overall user experience. One effective technique for achieving this is through efficient request batching.

## What is request batching?

Request batching is a technique that involves combining multiple API requests into a single request. Instead of making several network calls, we can consolidate them into one, reducing the network overhead and minimizing latency.

## Implementing request batching in Flutter web apps

Let's explore how we can implement request batching in Flutter web apps using the `http` package:

1. First, make sure you have added the `http` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```dart
dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.3
```

2. Import the required package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
```

3. Define a function that takes a list of API endpoints and makes a batch request:

```dart
Future<List<http.Response>> batchRequest(List<String> endpoints) async {
  final client = http.Client();
  final futures = <Future<http.Response>>[];

  for (final endpoint in endpoints) {
    futures.add(client.get(Uri.parse(endpoint)));
  }

  final responses = await Future.wait(futures);
  client.close();

  return responses;
}
```

4. Now, you can use this function to batch your API requests:

```dart
void makeBatchedRequest() async {
  final endpoints = [
    'https://api.example.com/endpoint1',
    'https://api.example.com/endpoint2',
    'https://api.example.com/endpoint3',
  ];

  final responses = await batchRequest(endpoints);

  // Process the responses
  for (final response in responses) {
    print(response.body);
  }
}
```

By batching the requests in this way, you can significantly reduce the number of network calls and minimize network latency.

## Conclusion

Minimizing network latency is crucial for delivering high-performance Flutter web apps. Efficient request batching allows you to combine multiple API requests into a single request, reducing network overhead and improving the user experience. By implementing this technique, you can optimize your app's performance and provide a seamless experience for your users.
