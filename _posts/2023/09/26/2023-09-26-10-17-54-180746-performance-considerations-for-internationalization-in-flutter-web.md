## 1. Use Lazy Localization

When using `Auto-generated` localization classes in Flutter, make sure to use lazy initialization. Lazy initialization allows the application to load the necessary localization resources only when they are actually needed, rather than loading the entire set of translations upfront. This can significantly reduce the initial page load time and overall memory usage.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart';

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)!.helloWorld);
  }
}
```

## 2. Optimize Locale Resolution

In order to support different locales, Flutter web apps usually rely on the `window.locale` property for locale resolution. However, the default behavior of the `window.locale` getter is to perform a costly string parsing operation. To optimize this, consider caching the resolved locale value during the application startup and reuse it throughout the runtime.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';

class LocalizationService {
  static Locale currentLocale = const Locale('en');

  static Future<void> initialize() async {
    // Resolve and cache the initial locale value
    // E.g. currentLocale = await fetchUserPreferredLocale();
  }
}

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Initialize localization service
  await LocalizationService.initialize();

  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Conclusion

Optimizing the performance of internationalization in Flutter web is crucial for delivering a smooth user experience. By implementing lazy localization and optimizing the locale resolution process, you can significantly enhance the performance of your Flutter web app. Remember to continually test and monitor the performance metrics to ensure your app performs efficiently for all users worldwide.
