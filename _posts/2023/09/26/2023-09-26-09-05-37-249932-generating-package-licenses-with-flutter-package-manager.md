When developing applications with Flutter, it's common to rely on various third-party packages to enhance functionality and accelerate development. However, most open-source packages come with their own licenses that need to be properly managed and documented in the project.

To simplify the process of generating a list of licenses for the packages used in a Flutter project, **Flutter Package Manager** comes to the rescue. This powerful tool automates the task of fetching licenses and generates a consolidated report for all dependencies used.

## Getting Started with Flutter Package Manager

First, make sure you have Flutter Package Manager installed. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ flutter pub global activate/flutter_package_manager
```

After installation, you can use Flutter Package Manager to generate a license report for your Flutter project.

## Generating a License Report

To generate a license report, navigate to the root directory of your Flutter project and run the following command:

```bash
$ flutter pub pub run flutter_package_manager
```

This command will initiate the process of analyzing the project's dependencies, fetching their licenses, and generating a consolidated report.

Once the command finishes executing, the license report will be generated in a file named "license_report.txt" in the root directory of your project. Open the file to review the list of packages and their associated licenses.

## Updating the License Report

Whenever you add or update packages in your Flutter project, it's essential to keep the license report up-to-date. To update the license report, simply re-run the command mentioned above:

```bash
$ flutter pub pub run flutter_package_manager
```

This will refresh the license information for your project's dependencies and update the license report accordingly.

## Conclusion

Flutter Package Manager simplifies the process of managing licenses for packages used in Flutter projects. By generating a consolidated license report, it ensures that you have a comprehensive overview of the licenses associated with your project's dependencies.

With Flutter Package Manager, you can easily stay compliant with the licenses of the packages used in your Flutter project, saving valuable time and effort.
