As web applications built with Flutter continue to gain popularity, it becomes crucial to ensure optimal performance and efficient utilization of resources. One important aspect is lazy loading, especially when it comes to JavaScript bundles.

Lazy loading refers to loading resources, such as JavaScript bundles, only when they are needed. This helps reduce the initial load time and improves the overall performance of the web application. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement efficient lazy loading of JavaScript bundles in Flutter web.

## Why lazy loading JavaScript bundles is important

When a web application loads, the browser downloads and executes all JavaScript bundles associated with the app. This can result in longer load times, especially for larger applications with extensive JavaScript code.

Lazy loading allows us to load JavaScript bundles only when they are required, which helps reduce the initial load time. By splitting the JavaScript bundles into smaller chunks, we can improve the application's performance and provide a better user experience.

## Implementing lazy loading in Flutter web

Flutter web, by default, creates a single JavaScript bundle that contains the entire application's code. To achieve lazy loading, we need to split the JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks and load them dynamically.

### 1. Code splitting

To split the JavaScript bundles, we can leverage Flutter's code splitting feature. This feature allows us to divide the application code into smaller units, known as code splits.

To create code splits, we can use the `defer` directive in the Flutter code. For example:

```dart
import 'package:deferred/hello.dart' deferred as hello;

void main() {
  hello.loadLibrary().then((_) {
    runApp(App());
  });
}

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              hello.sayHello(); // Call the code from the deferred library
            },
            child: Text('Say Hello'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `hello` code split is loaded only when the button is pressed. The `deferred` keyword ensures that the associated code is loaded on-demand.

### 2. Dynamic bundle loading

After splitting the JavaScript code, we need to load the code splits dynamically in response to user actions or specific scenarios. This can be done using the `import` function in JavaScript.

To dynamically load a code split, we can use the following code in our Flutter web application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart' show kIsWeb;

void loadJavaScriptBundle(String bundleURL) {
  if (kIsWeb) {
    var script = html.ScriptElement()
      ..src = bundleURL
      ..async = true;
    html.document.body!.append(script);
  }
}
```

The `loadJavaScriptBundle` function checks if the application is running on the web platform and creates a new script element with the specified `bundleURL`. It appends the script to the page's body, which triggers the dynamic loading of the JavaScript bundle.

### 3. Triggering bundle loading

With the code splits defined and the dynamic loading mechanism in place, we can now trigger the loading of the JavaScript bundles based on specific events or actions.

For example, in the previous code snippet, we loaded the `hello` code split when a button is pressed. Similarly, you can dynamically load JavaScript bundles on other events, such as page scrolling, user interactions, or route changes.

## Conclusion

Implementing efficient lazy loading of JavaScript bundles is essential for improving the performance of web applications built with Flutter. By leveraging code splitting and dynamic loading, we can load JavaScript bundles only when they are needed, resulting in faster load times and better user experiences.

Remember to consider lazy loading as part of your Flutter web development strategy to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization. #FlutterWeb #LazyLoading
