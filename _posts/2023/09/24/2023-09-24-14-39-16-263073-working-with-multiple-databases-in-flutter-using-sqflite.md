In this blog post, we will explore how to work with multiple databases in Flutter using the sqflite package. Sqflite is a Flutter plugin that allows us to interact with SQLite databases. By default, sqflite supports working with only one database instance at a time. However, there are cases where we may need to work with multiple databases simultaneously, and in this post, we will learn how to achieve that.

Before diving into the implementation details, let's first understand the need for multiple databases in Flutter.

## Why Work with Multiple Databases?

1. **Separation of Concerns**: By using multiple databases, we can separate different aspects of our application's data into logical units. For example, we can store user-related data in one database and application-related data in another.

2. **Improved Performance**: When dealing with huge amounts of data, splitting it across multiple databases can improve read and write operations as each database instance can handle a smaller subset of data.

Now, let's see how we can work with multiple databases in Flutter using sqflite.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add Dependencies

Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `sqflite` package as a dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  sqflite: ^2.0.0+3
  # ... other dependencies
```

Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the dependencies.

### Step 2: Create Database Helper Class

We need to create a helper class that encapsulates the functionality of working with multiple databases. Below is an example implementation:

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

class DatabaseHelper {
  static final DatabaseHelper _instance = DatabaseHelper.internal();
  static Database? _database;

  factory DatabaseHelper() => _instance;

  DatabaseHelper.internal();

  Future<Database?> get database async {
    if (_database != null) return _database;
    _database = await createDatabase();
    return _database;
  }

  Future<Database> createDatabase() async {
    // Create and open the database
    final path = await getDatabasesPath();
    final databasePath = '$path/my_database.db';
    final database = await openDatabase(databasePath, version: 1,
        onCreate: (Database db, int version) async {
      // Create tables and define schema
      await db.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE users (
          id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
          name TEXT
        )
      ''');
    });
    return database;
  }

  // Add other database operations like CRUD operations here
}
```

### Step 3: Working with Multiple Databases

Now that we have our `DatabaseHelper` class, we can create multiple instances of it to work with multiple databases. Here's an example usage:

```dart
DatabaseHelper usersDatabase = DatabaseHelper();
DatabaseHelper productsDatabase = DatabaseHelper();

void main() async {
  // To interact with the users database
  Database? usersDB = await usersDatabase.database;

  // To interact with the products database
  Database? productsDB = await productsDatabase.database;

  // Perform database operations
  // ...
}
```

By creating multiple instances of the `DatabaseHelper` class, we can ensure that each instance corresponds to a different database.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to work with multiple databases in Flutter using the sqflite package. We learned about the benefits of using multiple databases and implemented a simple helper class to facilitate working with them. By following these steps, you can effectively manage and interact with multiple databases in your Flutter applications.
