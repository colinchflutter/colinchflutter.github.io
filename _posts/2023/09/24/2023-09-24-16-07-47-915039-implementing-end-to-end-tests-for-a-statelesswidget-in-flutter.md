## Setting up the Test Environment

Before we dive into writing tests, make sure to have the `flutter_test` package added as a dev dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
```

After adding the package, run `flutter packages get` to ensure it is downloaded and available for your project.

## Writing the End-to-End Test

Let's say we have a simple `HelloWorld` widget that displays a static greeting message:

```dart
class HelloWorld extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      child: Text('Hello, World!'),
    );
  }
}
```

To test this widget, we can create an end-to-end test case using the `testWidgets` function from the `flutter_test` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('HelloWorld displays the correct greeting', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Pump the widget tree
    await tester.pumpWidget(HelloWorld());

    // Find the text widget
    final textFinder = find.text('Hello, World!');

    // Expect to find the text widget
    expect(textFinder, findsOneWidget);
  });
}

```
In this test case, we use the `pumpWidget` method to create the `HelloWorld` widget and render it. We then use the `find.text` method to find the `Text` widget with the greeting message.

Finally, we use the `expect` method to assert that we find exactly one widget with the given text.

## Running the Test

To run the end-to-end test, execute the following command in your project's root directory:

```
flutter test test/<your_test_file>.dart
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the test result indicating that the test passed.

## Conclusion

Writing end-to-end tests for stateless widgets in Flutter helps ensure that even the simplest UI components behave as expected. By leveraging the `flutter_test` package, we can easily create test cases to validate the rendering and behavior of our widgets.

Remember to run your tests regularly as part of your development process to catch any regressions and maintain the stability of your application's user interface.
