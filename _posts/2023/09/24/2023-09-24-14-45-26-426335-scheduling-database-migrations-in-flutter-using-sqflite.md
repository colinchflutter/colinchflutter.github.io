Flutter provides a powerful database package called `sqflite` that allows developers to interact with SQLite databases. When developing an app, there may be cases where you need to make changes to the database schema, like adding or modifying a table column. These changes require performing database migrations to ensure the data integrity. In this blog post, we will explore how to schedule and execute database migrations in Flutter using `sqflite`.

## What is a Database Migration?

A database migration is the process of updating a database schema to reflect changes in the application's data model. It involves modifying the structure or content of the database to accommodate changes such as adding or removing tables, columns, or relationships. Without proper migrations, existing data might become incompatible with the updated schema.

## Setting up sqflite

Before we dive into database migrations, we need to set up the `sqflite` package in our Flutter project. To do that, add the `sqflite` package as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  sqflite: <latest_version>
```

Then, run `flutter packages get` in your terminal to fetch the package.

## Implementing Database Migrations

To schedule and execute database migrations in `sqflite`, we can make use of the `openDatabase` method, which takes a callback function as a parameter. This callback function is executed when opening the database for the first time or after a version change.

Here's an example of how to schedule and execute a database migration:

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final database = await openDatabase('my_database.db', version: 2,
      onCreate: (db, version) async {
    // Create the initial schema
    await db.execute('''
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT,
        email TEXT
      )
      ''');
  }, onUpgrade: (db, oldVersion, newVersion) async {
    if (oldVersion == 1 && newVersion == 2) {
      // Perform the database migration
      await db.execute('ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone TEXT');
    }
  });

  // Use the database
  // ...
}
```

In the above code, the `openDatabase` method is called with the desired database file name and the desired version. Inside the `onCreate` function, we define the initial schema of the database. In the `onUpgrade` function, we check if the old version matches the expected version for the migration and perform the necessary changes.

## Conclusion

Database migrations are an essential part of maintaining data integrity when updating your Flutter application's database schema. With the `sqflite` package, it's straightforward to schedule and execute these migrations. By using the `openDatabase` method and providing appropriate callback functions, you can ensure that your app's database is always up-to-date with the latest schema changes.
