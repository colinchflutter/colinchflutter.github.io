If you're building a Flutter application that requires a local database, you may have come across the need for handling complex database schema changes. As your application evolves and new features are added, it's common to modify the database schema to accommodate these changes. However, updating the database schema can be challenging, especially when dealing with existing data.

In Flutter, the `sqflite` package is often used to work with SQLite databases. While `sqflite` provides a simple and effective way to manage databases, it doesn't have built-in support for handling schema changes. But don't worry, there are strategies you can follow to handle complex database schema changes in Flutter with `sqflite`.

## 1. Use database versioning

The first step in handling complex database schema changes is to implement database versioning. By assigning a version number to your database, you can track and manage schema changes over time. The version number is typically an integer that you increment whenever you make a schema change.

To define the version and create or upgrade the database, you can use the `openDatabase` method provided by the `sqflite` package. For example:

```dart
final database = await openDatabase(
  path,
  version: 2, // Your desired version number
  onCreate: (db, version) {
    // Create initial schema
  },
  onUpgrade: (db, oldVersion, newVersion) {
    if (oldVersion < 2) {
      // Perform schema changes for version 2
    } else if (oldVersion < 3) {
      // Perform schema changes for version 3
    }
    // Add further conditions for other versions
  },
);
```

In the `onUpgrade` method, you can define the necessary schema changes based on the old and new version numbers. This allows you to handle different schema upgrades depending on the starting and target versions.

## 2. Migrate existing data

In addition to modifying the schema, you may also need to migrate existing data to align with the new schema. This can be challenging, especially when dealing with complex data structures.

To handle data migration, you can create migration scripts that convert the existing data to match the new schema. These scripts can be written using SQL queries or using higher-level database migration libraries like `moor` or `sqflite_migration_plan`.

For example, let's consider a scenario where you added a new field `isActive` to an existing table `User`. To migrate the existing data, you can create a migration script like this:

```dart
Future<void> _migrateUsers(Database db) async {
  await db.execute('ALTER TABLE User ADD COLUMN isActive INTEGER DEFAULT 0;');
  await db.execute('UPDATE User SET isActive = 1 WHERE isActive IS NULL;');
}
```

In this script, the first SQL query adds the `isActive` column to the `User` table, while the second query sets the default value of `isActive` to `1` for all existing rows where it's `NULL`.

## Conclusion

Handling complex database schema changes in Flutter with `sqflite` requires careful planning and organization. By following database versioning and implementing data migration strategies, you can effectively manage schema changes and ensure a smooth upgrade process for your users. Remember to increment the version number for each schema change and handle migrations accordingly.
