In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement image and video uploading functionality in a `StatelessWidget` in Flutter. We will make use of the `image_picker` and `video_player` plugins to achieve this.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed
- A Flutter project set up

## Installing Required Packages

Open your project's `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_picker: ^0.8.4+2
  video_player: ^2.2.6
```

Save the file and run `flutter pub get` to fetch the packages.

## Implementing the Uploader Widget

Create a new file named `uploader_widget.dart` in your project's `lib` directory. Add the following code to create the `Uploader` widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_picker/image_picker.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';

class Uploader extends StatelessWidget {
  final ImagePicker _imagePicker = ImagePicker();
  final TextEditingController _captionController = TextEditingController();
  VideoPlayerController? _videoController;

  Future<void> _uploadImage() async {
    final XFile? image = await _imagePicker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
    if (image != null) {
      // Implement your image uploading logic here
    }
  }

  Future<void> _uploadVideo() async {
    final XFile? video = await _imagePicker.pickVideo(source: ImageSource.gallery);
    if (video != null) {
      _videoController = VideoPlayerController.file(File(video.path));
      await _videoController!.initialize();
      // Implement your video uploading logic here
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _uploadImage,
          child: Text('Upload Image'),
        ),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _uploadVideo,
          child: Text('Upload Video'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

## Using the Uploader Widget

Now, let's use the `Uploader` widget in your main application. Open `main.dart` and replace the existing code with the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'uploader_widget.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image and Video Uploader',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Image and Video Uploader'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Uploader(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Save the file and run your application using `flutter run`. You should now see the "Upload Image" and "Upload Video" buttons on the screen.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to implement image and video uploading functionality in a `StatelessWidget` in Flutter. We used the `image_picker` and `video_player` plugins to achieve this. You can now customize the code to suit your specific requirements for handling image and video uploads in your Flutter application.
