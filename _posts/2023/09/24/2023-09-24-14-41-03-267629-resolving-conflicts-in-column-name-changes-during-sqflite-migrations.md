When working with an SQLite database in Flutter using the sqflite package, you may encounter situations where you need to change the name of a column during database migrations. However, changing the name of a column can lead to conflicts if the database already contains data and there are references to the old column name.

To resolve conflicts related to column name changes during SQLite migrations using sqflite, follow these steps:

1. Add a new column with the desired name: In your migration script, add a new column with the updated name using the `ALTER TABLE` statement. For example, suppose you want to change the name of the column `old_column` to `new_column` in a table called `my_table`. The migration script would look like this:

```dart
await db.execute('ALTER TABLE my_table ADD COLUMN new_column TEXT');
```

2. Copy data from the old column to the new column: Next, you need to copy the data from the old column to the newly added column. You can achieve this by executing an `UPDATE` statement:

```dart
await db.execute('UPDATE my_table SET new_column = old_column');
```

3. Resolve conflicts: If there are any conflicts due to the column name change, you need to handle them manually. For example, if the column `old_column` is used in any other tables or queries, you'll need to update those references accordingly.

4. Remove the old column: Finally, after resolving all conflicts, you can remove the old column using the `ALTER TABLE` statement:

```dart
await db.execute('ALTER TABLE my_table DROP COLUMN old_column');
```

By following these steps, you can successfully resolve conflicts that may arise due to column name changes during SQLite database migrations in Flutter using sqflite.
