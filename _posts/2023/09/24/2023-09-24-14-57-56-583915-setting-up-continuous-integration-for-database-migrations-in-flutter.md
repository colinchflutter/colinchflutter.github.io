In a Flutter project, **continuous integration** (CI) plays a crucial role in ensuring the stability and quality of your application. When it comes to managing database migrations, CI becomes even more important to avoid any compatibility or data integrity issues during the deployment process.

In this blog post, we will discuss how to set up CI for handling database migrations in a Flutter project using popular tools such as **GitHub Actions**.

## Why Continuous Integration?

Continuous Integration is a development practice that involves regularly integrating code changes into a shared repository. By running automated tests and validations, CI systems help catch bugs and streamline the deployment process. This is especially important when dealing with database migrations.

## Steps to Set up CI for Database Migrations

### 1. Choose a CI Provider

There are several CI providers available, including **GitHub Actions**, Travis CI, and CircleCI. For this tutorial, we will be using GitHub Actions.

### 2. Create a CI Workflow File

To start, create a `.github/workflows` directory in your Flutter project's root folder. Next, create a YAML file, for example, `ci.yml`, to define your CI workflow.

### 3. Define CI Workflow Steps

To handle database migrations in CI, your workflow should include the following steps:

#### a. Set up the Flutter Environment

```yaml
- name: Set up Flutter
  uses: subosito/flutter-action@v1
```

This step ensures that the Flutter SDK is properly installed and set up.

#### b. Set up the Database

Before running database migrations, you need to set up a temporary database. Depending on your database provider, you can use Docker or an equivalent service to spin up a container.

#### c. Run Database Migrations

Next, you need to run the database migration commands. This depends on the database management tool you are using, such as **Sqflite** for Flutter SQLite or **Firebase Firestore** for Cloud Firestore.

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: flutter pub get
  
- name: Run database migrations
  run: flutter pub run flutter_migrate:main --directory=database/migrations/
```

Make sure to adjust the path (`--directory`) based on your project's folder structure.

#### d. Run Tests

After running the migrations, it is essential to run tests to ensure that the database changes have been applied successfully and the application functionality remains intact.

```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: flutter test
```

### 4. Define CI Workflow Triggers

Specify the triggers for your CI workflow. For example, you can configure it to run on every push to the `main` branch or on pull requests.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
```

## Conclusion

Setting up continuous integration for Flutter database migrations helps maintain the integrity and stability of your application. By automating the migration process, you can quickly catch any issues related to database compatibility and ensure a smooth deployment.

In this blog post, we discussed how to set up CI for database migrations in a Flutter project using **GitHub Actions**. By following the steps outlined, you can seamlessly integrate database changes and tests into your CI workflow, allowing for faster iterations and enhanced development workflow.
