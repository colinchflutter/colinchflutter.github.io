Migrating database tables is a common task when working with databases, especially when developing mobile applications using frameworks like Flutter. In this blog post, we'll explore how to handle table renaming in the `sqflite` package, a popular SQLite plugin for Flutter.

## Why Renaming Tables?

There are many scenarios where you might need to rename a table in your database. It could be due to changes in your application's data model, rebranding, or simply improving the clarity of table names. Regardless of the reason, performing this operation correctly is crucial to maintaining data integrity and preventing data loss.

## Step 1: Create a New Table

The first step in renaming a table is to create a new table with the updated name and structure. You can do this by executing a SQL query using the `execute` method of the `Database` object, provided by `sqflite`. Here's an example:

```dart
Future<void> createNewTable(Database db) async {
  await db.execute('CREATE TABLE new_table (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)');
}
```

This code creates a new table named `new_table` with an `id` column of type `INTEGER` as the primary key and a `name` column of type `TEXT`. Make sure to update the column structure to match your specific requirements.

## Step 2: Copy Data

Next, you need to transfer the data from the old table to the new one. Again, an SQL query using the `execute` method can achieve this. Here's an example:

```dart
Future<void> copyData(Database db) async {
  await db.execute('INSERT INTO new_table SELECT * FROM old_table');
}
```

In this code, we use the `INSERT INTO` statement to insert the data from the `old_table` into the `new_table`. The `SELECT * FROM` statement selects all rows from the `old_table` and inserts them into the `new_table`. Be sure to update the table names accordingly.

## Step 3: Drop Old Table

After successfully copying the data, you can drop the old table to clean up the database. Use the `execute` method to execute an `DROP TABLE` SQL statement:

```dart
Future<void> dropOldTable(Database db) async {
  await db.execute('DROP TABLE old_table');
}
```

This code executes the `DROP TABLE` statement to remove the `old_table` from the database.

## Step 4: Perform the Migration

To execute these steps during a database migration, you need to provide the upgrading logic in the `onUpgrade` method of the `Database` helper class. Here's an example of how to implement the migration logic:

```dart
Future<void> _onUpgrade(Database db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) async {
  if (oldVersion == 1 && newVersion == 2) {
    // Step 1: Create new table
    await createNewTable(db);

    // Step 2: Copy data
    await copyData(db);

    // Step 3: Drop old table
    await dropOldTable(db);
  }
}
```

In this code snippet, we check if the old version is 1 and the new version is 2 before performing the migration steps. You can adjust this logic to match your specific version requirements.

## Conclusion

Handling table renaming during database migrations in `sqflite` is straightforward once you understand the necessary steps. By creating a new table, copying the data, and dropping the old table, you can successfully rename tables without losing any important data. Remember to adapt the code snippets to your specific use case and enjoy a seamless database migration experience in your Flutter applications.
