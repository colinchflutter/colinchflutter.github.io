As your Flutter app grows, you may need to make changes to your SQLite database structure. This can be achieved by using migrations in the [sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite) package. Migrations allow you to update your database schema, insert initial data, or perform any other necessary tasks.

While sqflite provides a convenient way to perform database operations, it doesn't offer a built-in mechanism to execute raw SQL statements during migrations. However, there is a straightforward workaround to accomplish this.

## Using sqflite's `execute` method

To execute raw SQL statements in your database migrations, you can make use of sqflite's `execute` method. This method allows you to run arbitrary SQL statements against your SQLite database.

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

Future<void> upgradeDatabase(Database database, int oldVersion, int newVersion) async {
  if (oldVersion < 2) {
    // Execute your raw SQL statement here
    await database.execute('ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN age INT');
  }

  if (oldVersion < 3) {
    // Execute another raw SQL statement
    await database.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)');
  }

  // Update the version table to reflect the new version
  await database.update('version', {'version': newVersion});
}

void main() async {
  final database = await openDatabase('my_database.db', version: 3,
      onCreate: (db, version) async {
    await db.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)');
    await db.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS version (version INTEGER)');
  }, onUpgrade: upgradeDatabase, onOpen: (db) {
    // Perform any necessary actions when the database is opened
  });


  // Rest of your app code...
}
```

By utilizing the `execute` method within the migration process, you can execute any SQL statement required during database upgrades.

## Conclusion

While Flutter's sqflite package doesn't offer a built-in mechanism for executing raw SQL statements in migrations, using the `execute` method provides a straightforward solution. By incorporating this approach, you can enhance the capabilities of your SQLite database in a Flutter app. Have fun coding!
