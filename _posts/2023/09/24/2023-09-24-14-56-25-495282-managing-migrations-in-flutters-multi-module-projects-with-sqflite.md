Managing database migrations is a crucial aspect of any application development, including Flutter projects. When working with multi-module projects, it becomes essential to handle database migrations efficiently. In this blog post, we will explore how to manage migrations in Flutter's multi-module projects using the popular package, sqflite.

## What is sqflite?

sqflite is a popular Flutter package that provides a simple and efficient way to interact with SQLite databases in your Flutter applications. It offers various features to manage and manipulate SQLite databases, making it a favored choice for many Flutter developers.

## Challenges with Database Migrations in Multi-Module Projects

In multi-module projects, each module can have its own database with its corresponding migrations. However, managing migrations across multiple modules can become a challenge. Some common challenges include:

1. **Synchronization**: Ensuring that all modules stay synchronized with the database schema and migration history.
2. **Dependency Management**: Handling interdependencies between modules that share a common database or rely on each other's migrations.
3. **Versioning**: Managing the versioning of the database across modules and handling conflicts.

## Approach to Managing Migrations

To efficiently manage migrations in a multi-module project, we can follow the following approach:

1. **Centralized Migration Management**: Create a dedicated module solely responsible for handling database migrations. This module will have the necessary code to execute migrations and track the migration history.

2. **Shared Database Schema**: Define the database schema in the migration management module. All other modules will have their migrations that modify or extend this shared schema. By sharing a common schema, you ensure consistency across modules.

3. **Dependency Management**: In the dependencies of each module, include the migration management module to ensure that migrations are executed in the correct order.

4. **Migrations Execution**: Whenever the application launches (or at a specific point), execute the pending migrations. The migration management module can handle this task by checking the current schema version against the latest version and executing the pending migrations accordingly.

5. **Versioning**: Maintain a central schema version, and each module will have its own migrations with their version numbers. This allows for independent migration management while ensuring overall version consistency.

## Example Code

To illustrate the approach, let's consider a simple multi-module Flutter project with two modules - `users` and `products`.

1. Create a new module called `migrations` that will handle database migration management. This module will have the shared database schema and code to execute and track migrations.

2. Define the database schema in the `migrations` module, along with the necessary migration scripts.

   ```dart
   // migrations/lib/schema.dart

   class AppDatabase {
     static final AppDatabase _singleton = AppDatabase._internal();

     factory AppDatabase() {
       return _singleton;
     }

     Database _database;
     int _schemaVersion = 1;

     Future<void> _migrate(Database db, int from, int to) async {
       // Perform necessary migrations between versions
     }

     Future<AppDatabase> init() async {
       // Initialize database and execute pending migrations
       return _singleton;
     }
   }
   ```

3. In the `users` and `products` modules, include the `migrations` module as a dependency in `pubspec.yaml`.

   ```yaml
   # users/pubspec.yaml and products/pubspec.yaml

   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     migrations: 
       path: ../migrations
   ```

4. In each module, include the necessary migrations using the `migrations` package.

   ```dart
   // users/lib/migrations.dart

   import 'package:migrations/migrations.dart';
   import 'package:migrations/schema.dart';

   class UsersMigrations extends Migrations {
     @override
     List<Migration> get migrations => [
       Migration(
         version: 1,
         up: (db) async {
           // Migration steps for version 1
         },
         down: (db) async {
           // Rollback steps for version 1
         },
       ),
       // Add more migrations as necessary
     ];
   }

   // products/lib/migrations.dart

   import 'package:migrations/migrations.dart';
   import 'package:migrations/schema.dart';

   class ProductsMigrations extends Migrations {
     @override
     List<Migration> get migrations => [
       Migration(
         version: 1,
         up: (db) async {
           // Migration steps for version 1
         },
         down: (db) async {
           // Rollback steps for version 1
         },
       ),
       // Add more migrations as necessary
     ];
   }
   ```

5. In the main application module (e.g., `main.dart`), initiate the `AppDatabase` to ensure that the migrations are executed.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:migrations/schema.dart';

   void main() async {
     WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

     await AppDatabase().init();

     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

## Conclusion

Managing database migrations in multi-module projects is crucial to ensure schema consistency and handle versioning. By following the approach outlined above, using the sqflite package, you can efficiently handle migrations across multiple modules in your Flutter application.
