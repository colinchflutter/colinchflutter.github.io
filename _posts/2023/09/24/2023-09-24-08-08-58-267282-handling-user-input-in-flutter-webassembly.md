## Introduction

Flutter is a cross-platform framework that allows developers to build beautiful and natively compiled applications for web, mobile, and desktop using a single codebase. With the introduction of Flutter Web, developers can now use Flutter to build applications that run on the web using WebAssembly.

One of the essential aspects of building interactive web applications is handling user input. In this blog post, we will explore how to handle user input in Flutter WebAssembly and discuss various input widgets provided by Flutter.

## Handling Text Input

In Flutter WebAssembly, handling text input is similar to how it is done in Flutter for mobile platforms. Flutter provides the `TextField` widget that allows users to enter text. To handle the input, you can use the `onChanged` callback, which provides the current value of the text field every time it changes.

Here's an example of how to handle text input in Flutter WebAssembly using the `TextField` widget:

```
TextField(
  onChanged: (value) {
    // Do something with the entered text
  },
)
```

## Handling Button Clicks

Handling button clicks in Flutter WebAssembly is also similar to other Flutter platforms. Flutter provides several button widgets, such as `ElevatedButton`, `TextButton`, and `IconButton`. To handle a button click, you can use the `onPressed` callback, which gets triggered when the button is pressed.

Here's an example of handling a button click in Flutter WebAssembly using the `ElevatedButton` widget:

```
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle the button click
  },
  child: Text("Click me"),
)
```

## Handling Gesture Recognizers

In addition to handling basic user input like text input and button clicks, Flutter WebAssembly also enables handling more advanced user interactions using gesture recognizers. Flutter provides various gesture recognizers, such as `GestureDetector`, `Draggable`, and `GestureDetector`.

Here's an example of handling a swipe gesture using the `GestureDetector` widget:

```
GestureDetector(
  onPanUpdate: (details) {
    if (details.delta.dx > 0) {
      // Handle right swipe
    } else if (details.delta.dx < 0) {
      // Handle left swipe
    }
  },
  child: Container(
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
    child: Text("Swipe me!"),
  ),
)
```

## Conclusion

Handling user input is vital for building interactive web applications. In this blog post, we explored how to handle text input, button clicks, and gesture recognizers in Flutter WebAssembly. By leveraging the input widgets and gesture recognizers provided by Flutter, developers can create engaging web applications.
