WebRTC is a powerful technology that allows developers to create real-time communication applications in a browser or a mobile application. In this blog post, we will explore how we can leverage WebRTC in Flutter WebAssembly to build collaborative applications.

## What is WebRTC
WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is an open-source project that provides real-time communication between browsers or mobile applications using a peer-to-peer connection. It is built using JavaScript APIs and allows for audio, video, and data transmission between participants.

## Flutter WebAssembly
Flutter WebAssembly is a technology that allows Flutter applications to be compiled into WebAssembly code. With Flutter WebAssembly, developers can write applications in Dart (the programming language used in Flutter) and run them natively in the browser without the need for a JavaScript bridge.

## Integrating WebRTC with Flutter WebAssembly
To integrate WebRTC into your Flutter WebAssembly application, you can use the `flutter_webrtc` package, which provides a Flutter API wrapper around the native WebRTC implementation. This package allows you to easily access and utilize the various WebRTC features in your application.

Here is an example code snippet on how to set up a basic WebRTC video call in Flutter WebAssembly:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_webrtc/flutter_webrtc.dart';

// Create a new instance of the PeerConnection class
final peerConnection = await createPeerConnection(configuration);

// Callback function for handling incoming video stream
void handleIncomingStream(MediaStream stream) {
  // Add the incoming stream to a video element on the page
  final videoElement = VideoElement();
  videoElement.srcObject = stream;
  videoElement.play();
}

// Generate an offer to initiate the call
final offer = await peerConnection.createOffer();

// Set the generated offer as the local description
await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(offer);

// Send the offer to the remote peer and wait for their answer
final answer = await sendOfferToRemotePeer(offer);

// Set the remote answer as the remote description
await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(answer);

// Start listening for incoming video streams
peerConnection.onAddStream = handleIncomingStream;
```

## Advantages of Building Collaborative Applications with WebRTC in Flutter WebAssembly
1. Cross-platform Compatibility: With Flutter WebAssembly, your collaborative application can run in any modern browser, regardless of the operating system. This allows you to reach a wider audience and ensures a consistent user experience.
2. Native Performance: By compiling Flutter to WebAssembly, your application can benefit from the performance advantages of running natively in the browser. This results in smoother real-time communication and a more responsive user interface.

In conclusion, leveraging WebRTC in Flutter WebAssembly allows developers to build powerful collaborative applications that can run directly in the browser. With the ability to create real-time audio, video, and data connections, WebRTC opens up new possibilities for communication and collaboration. So why not give it a try and start building your own collaborative application today!
