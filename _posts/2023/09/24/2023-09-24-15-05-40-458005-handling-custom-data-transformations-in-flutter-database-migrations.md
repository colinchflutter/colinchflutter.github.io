Database migrations are an important aspect of maintaining and evolving a Flutter app that utilizes a local database for data storage. But what happens when you need to perform custom data transformations during the migration process? In this blog post, we will explore how to handle such scenarios in Flutter database migrations.

## Understanding database migrations in Flutter

Before diving into custom data transformations, let's quickly recap what database migrations are in the context of Flutter. Database migrations are a way to manage changes to the structure (schema) of a database. They allow you to modify tables, add new columns, and perform other schema changes while preserving the existing data.

## Custom data transformations

In some cases, the schema changes you make during a migration might require more than just altering the structure of the tables. You might need to transform the existing data to fit the new schema. For example, you might need to convert the format of a date column or normalize data spread across multiple tables.

To handle these kinds of custom data transformations during a migration, you can follow these steps:

1. In the **onUpgrade** method of your migration's **MigrationStrategy**, fetch the data you want to transform from the old schema.
```dart
@override
Future<void> onUpgrade(Database database, int oldVersion, int newVersion) async {
    // Fetch data to transform from old schema
    List<Map<String, dynamic>> data = await database.rawQuery('SELECT * FROM old_table');
    ...
}
```

2. Perform any necessary data transformations on the retrieved data. You can use familiar Dart functions and libraries to accomplish this. For example, you can use the **intl** package to format dates or perform string manipulations.
```dart
@override
Future<void> onUpgrade(Database database, int oldVersion, int newVersion) async {
    ...
    // Perform custom data transformations
    List<Map<String, dynamic>> transformedData = data.map((record) {
        String transformedValue = transformValue(record['value']);
        return {
            'id': record['id'],
            'transformed_value': transformedValue,
        };
    }).toList();
    ...
}
```

3. Create new tables or modify existing ones to accommodate the transformed data.
```dart
@override
Future<void> onUpgrade(Database database, int oldVersion, int newVersion) async {
    ...
    // Create new tables or modify existing ones
    await database.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS old_table');
    await database.execute('CREATE TABLE new_table (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, transformed_value TEXT)');
    ...
}
```

4. Insert the transformed data into the new tables.
```dart
@override
Future<void> onUpgrade(Database database, int oldVersion, int newVersion) async {
    ...
    // Insert transformed data into new tables
    for (Map<String, dynamic> transformedRecord in transformedData) {
        await database.insert('new_table', transformedRecord);
    }
    ...
}
```

## Conclusion

Handling custom data transformations during database migrations in Flutter requires some additional steps beyond the usual schema changes. By fetching and transforming data from the old schema, creating or modifying tables, and inserting the transformed data, you can ensure a smooth transition to the new database structure.

Remember that each migration should be idempotent, meaning you can run it multiple times without causing data corruption. **Make sure to test your migrations thoroughly** to avoid unexpected issues.
