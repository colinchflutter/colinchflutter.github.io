In modern app development, data security and privacy are of utmost importance. One crucial aspect is protecting sensitive data stored in databases. In this article, we'll explore how to handle data masking and tokenization in Flutter's `sqflite` migrations, ensuring the privacy and security of user information.

## What is Data Masking?

Data masking is a technique used to hide or obfuscate sensitive data, such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, or email addresses. Masking replaces the original data with fictional or random values, preserving the format but rendering it unreadable. This technique adds an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access.

## What is Tokenization?

Tokenization is another data protection approach that involves substituting sensitive data with unique identifiers called tokens. These tokens can be used as references to retrieve the original data when necessary. Tokenization helps prevent direct exposure of sensitive information and reduces the risk of data theft.

## Implementing Data Masking and Tokenization in sqflite Migrations

When using Flutter's `sqflite` package for database management, we can leverage its migration feature to apply data masking and tokenization during database schema updates. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Define a Migration Step

First, define a migration step that incorporates the necessary transformations. This step should be added to the `onUpgrade` method in your SQLite database helper class. Use the `rawUpdate` method to execute SQL statements on the database.

```dart
@override
void onUpgrade(Database db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) async {
  if (newVersion > oldVersion) {
    if (newVersion == 2) {
      await db.execute("""
        UPDATE table_name
        SET sensitive_column = 'XXXXXX'
        WHERE sensitive_column IS NOT NULL;
      """);
    }
    // Add more migration steps as needed for other versions
  }
}
```

The example above shows a single migration step for version 2 of the database schema. It updates the `sensitive_column` value to 'XXXXXX', effectively masking the data.

### 2. Utilize Tokens for Sensitive Data

To implement tokenization, you can modify the migration step to include token replacement. First, add a new table to store the original sensitive data and its associated tokens.

```dart
@override
void onCreate(Database db, int version) async {
  await db.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE sensitive_data (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      sensitive_info TEXT,
      token TEXT
    )
  ''');
}
```

Next, populate this table with the original data and corresponding tokens. When performing the migration, update the main table with tokens and secure the sensitive information in the `sensitive_data` table.

### 3. Retrieve Sensitive Data with Tokens

Whenever you need to retrieve the sensitive data from the database, implement a method to look up the original data using tokens.

```dart
Future<String> retrieveSensitiveData(int id) async {
  final db = await instance.database;
  final tokenResult = await db.query('sensitive_data',
      columns: ['token'],
      where: 'id = ?',
      whereArgs: [id]);

  if (tokenResult.isEmpty) {
    return null;
  }

  final token = tokenResult.first['token'];

  final dataResult = await db.query('sensitive_data',
      columns: ['sensitive_info'],
      where: 'token = ?',
      whereArgs: [token]);

  if (dataResult.isEmpty) {
    return null;
  }

  return dataResult.first['sensitive_info'];
}
```

The example above demonstrates how to retrieve sensitive data using tokens. First, the token associated with the given `id` is fetched from the `sensitive_data` table. Then, the original data is retrieved using the token.

## Conclusion

By incorporating data masking and tokenization techniques into Flutter's `sqflite` migrations, you can effectively protect sensitive data stored in your app's databases. Using masks or tokens ensures that even if the database is compromised, the sensitive information remains secure from unauthorized access.
