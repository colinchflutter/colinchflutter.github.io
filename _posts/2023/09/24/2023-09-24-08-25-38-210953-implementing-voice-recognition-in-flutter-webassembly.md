With the advancement in technology, voice recognition has become an integral part of many applications. Whether it's for voice commands, transcription, or voice-controlled interfaces, integrating voice recognition into your Flutter WebAssembly applications can enhance the user experience and provide more accessibility options.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement voice recognition in Flutter WebAssembly using the Web Speech API and showcase a basic example.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Flutter and WebAssembly.

## Getting Started

1. Set up a new Flutter project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter create voice_recognition_flutter_web
```

2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.

3. Replace the content of `lib/main.dart` with the following code:

```dart
import 'dart:html';

void main() {
  // Check if Web Speech API is available
  if (SpeechRecognition.supported) {
    final recognizer = SpeechRecognition();

    recognizer.onResult.listen((event) {
      final speechResult = event.results.first[0].transcript;
      print(speechResult);
    });

    recognizer.start();
  } else {
    print("Web Speech API is not supported.");
  }
}
```

4. Save the changes and run the Flutter project using the following command:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter application and checks if the Web Speech API is supported. If supported, it initializes a SpeechRecognition object and listens for speech recognition results. The recognized speech is then printed to the console.

## Testing the Voice Recognition

Once the Flutter application is running, it will automatically start listening for speech input. Open the Chrome developer console by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+J** (or **Cmd+Option+J** on macOS) to view the printed speech results.

Speak a few sentences, and you should see the recognized speech appearing in the console.

## Conclusion

Integrating voice recognition into Flutter WebAssembly applications opens up a range of possibilities for creating more interactive and accessible apps. By utilizing the Web Speech API, you can easily capture voice inputs and process them accordingly.

This example demonstrates the basic setup of voice recognition in Flutter WebAssembly. You can further enhance it by implementing commands, advanced processing, or integrating it with other features of your application.
