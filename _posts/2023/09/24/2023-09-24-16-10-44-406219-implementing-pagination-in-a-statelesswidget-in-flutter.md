Pagination is an essential feature in mobile and web applications where there is a need to display large amounts of data in a limited space. In Flutter, we can implement pagination to load and display data incrementally as the user scrolls or requests for more data.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement pagination in a `StatelessWidget` in Flutter using the `ListView.builder` widget.

### Setting up the project

Before we dive into the implementation, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can follow the official documentation on how to set up Flutter:

```bash
flutter create pagination_example
cd pagination_example
```

Open the project in your favorite IDE and let's get started!

### Implementing the pagination logic

To implement pagination in a `StatelessWidget`, we need to maintain a few variables to keep track of the current page, the number of items per page, and the total number of items in the dataset.

Let's start by creating a `PaginationList` class, which is responsible for loading and displaying the paginated data. Here's the basic structure of our class:

```dart
class PaginationList extends StatelessWidget {
  final int itemsPerPage = 10;
  final int totalItems = 100;
  final ScrollController scrollController = ScrollController();
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Pagination Example'),
      ),
      body: _buildList(),
    );
  }

  Widget _buildList() {
    // TODO: Implement the list view builder and pagination logic
  }
}
```

### Implementing the `ListView.builder` widget with pagination

Inside the `_buildList()` method, we will use the `ListView.builder` widget to display the items. The `ListView.builder` allows us to create a list dynamically based on a delegate that lazily builds the list items.

To implement pagination, we need to listen to the scroll events using the `ScrollController`. In the `initState()` method, we can attach the listener to the controller and listen for scroll events:

```dart
scrollController.addListener(() {
  if (scrollController.position.pixels >=
      scrollController.position.maxScrollExtent) {
    // TODO: Load more data
  }
});
```

Next, we need to determine the range of items to display based on the current page and the number of items per page. We can do this by calculating the start and end indexes of the sublist:

```dart
int start = currentPage * itemsPerPage;
int end = (currentPage + 1) * itemsPerPage;
if (end > totalItems) {
  end = totalItems;
}
```

Finally, we can pass the sublist to the `ListView.builder` as the `itemCount` and use the `itemBuilder` to build the individual list items. Here's the complete implementation of the `_buildList()` method:

```dart
Widget _buildList() {
  return ListView.builder(
    controller: scrollController,
    itemCount: end,
    itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
      if (index == end - 1) {
        currentPage++;
      }

      return ListTile(
        title: Text('Item $index'),
      );
    },
  );
}
```

### Testing the pagination

To test the pagination implementation, simply add an instance of the `PaginationList` to your Flutter app's `runApp()` method:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: PaginationList(),
    ),
  );
}
```

Now, when you run the app, you should see a scrolling list that loads data incrementally as you scroll.

### Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to implement pagination in a `StatelessWidget` in Flutter. By using the `ListView.builder` widget and a `ScrollController`, we can easily achieve the pagination functionality in our Flutter applications. Feel free to customize and extend this implementation to suit your specific use case.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»
