With the growing popularity of dark mode, it has become important for developers to provide users with the option to switch between light and dark themes in their apps. In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement light mode in a StatelessWidget in Flutter.

Flutter makes it quite easy to add light mode support to your app. Let's get started with the implementation.

## Step 1: Set Up a Light Theme

First, we need to define a light theme for our app. To do this, create a new file called `light_theme.dart` and add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

final lightTheme = ThemeData(
  brightness: Brightness.light,
  /* Other theme settings like colors, typography, etc. */
);
```

You can customize the theme settings according to your app's requirements.

## Step 2: Create a Light Mode Stateless Widget

Now, let's create a `LightModeWidget` class that extends `StatelessWidget` and wraps the main content of our app. Here's an example implementation:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class LightModeWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget child;

  const LightModeWidget({required this.child});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Theme(
      data: lightTheme,
      child: child,
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, we use the `Theme` widget provided by Flutter to wrap the `child` widget with the `lightTheme`.

## Step 3: Using the Light Mode Widget

To enable light mode in your app, simply wrap your main app widget with the `LightModeWidget`. Here's an example:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LightModeWidget(
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'My App',
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the code above, we wrap the `MaterialApp` with `LightModeWidget`, ensuring that the theme specified in `lightTheme` is applied to the entire app.

That's it! You have successfully implemented light mode in a StatelessWidget in Flutter. Users can now switch between light and dark themes in your app, providing them with a more customizable experience.

Implementing light mode can greatly enhance the usability of your app and make it more accessible to users with different preferences. Give it a try in your Flutter apps and see the difference it can make!
