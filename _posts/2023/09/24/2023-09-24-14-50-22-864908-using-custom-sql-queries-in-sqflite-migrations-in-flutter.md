Migrations are an essential part of managing database schema changes in mobile applications. In a Flutter app, `sqflite` is a popular plugin used for working with SQLite databases. It provides a convenient way to execute SQL queries and manage migrations.

By default, `sqflite` supports basic SQL queries for creating tables and modifying columns. However, there might be cases when you need to perform more complex database operations during migrations, such as renaming tables or adding unique constraints. In such scenarios, you can use custom SQL queries within your migration scripts.

## Writing a Migration Script

1. First, make sure you have added `sqflite` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sqflite: ^2.0.0+3
  path_provider: ^2.0.2
```

2. Create a new migration script file, such as `001_initial_migration.dart`, in your project's `lib` directory.

3. Define a class with a `migrate` method that will execute the desired SQL queries.

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

class InitialMigration {
  Future<void> migrate(Database database) async {
    // Execute your custom SQL queries here
    await database.execute('ALTER TABLE old_table_name RENAME TO new_table_name;');
    await database.execute('CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name ON table_name(column_name);');
    // ...
  }
}
```

4. Inside the `migrate` method, write your custom SQL queries using the `execute` method from the `Database` class. You can perform any valid SQL operation within these queries.

5. Once you have defined your migration script, you can use it with the `sqflite` plugin to perform the migration.

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';
import 'package:path/path.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final databasePath = await getDatabasesPath();
  final database = await openDatabase(join(databasePath, 'your_database.db'));

  // Run the migration
  final migration = InitialMigration();
  await migration.migrate(database);

  // Close the database
  await database.close();
}
```

## Summary

In this tutorial, you have learned how to use custom SQL queries within Sqflite migrations in Flutter. By writing custom SQL queries, you can perform various database operations beyond the basic capabilities provided by the plugin. This allows you to handle complex schema changes and ensure your app's database remains up-to-date. #Flutter #Sqflite #Migrations
