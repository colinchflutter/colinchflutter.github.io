Flutter is a powerful framework that allows developers to build high-performance user interfaces across different platforms, including the web. With the introduction of Flutter WebAssembly (or Flutter Web), developers can now create web applications using Flutter's expressive UI widgets and efficient programming model.

When building web applications, one common task is to handle network requests, such as fetching data from an API or submitting form data to a server. In this blog post, we will explore how to handle network requests in Flutter WebAssembly and make the most out of the available options.

## Using the `http` package

Flutter provides the `http` package, which offers a convenient way to handle network requests. To use this package, you need to add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.3
```

After adding the dependency, you can import the `http` package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
```

### Making GET requests

To make a GET request to an API endpoint, you can use the `get()` function provided by the `http` package. Here's an example:

```dart
http.Response response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/data'));
print(response.statusCode); // HTTP response status code
print(response.body); // Response body
```

In the above example, we first create a `Uri` object that represents the API endpoint we want to fetch data from. We then pass the `Uri` to the `get()` function, which returns a `http.Response` object. We can access the response's status code and body using the respective properties.

### Making POST requests

To make a POST request, you can use the `post()` function from the `http` package. Here's an example:

```dart
http.Response response = await http.post(Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/submit'), body: {'name': 'John', 'email': 'john@example.com'});
print(response.statusCode); // HTTP response status code
print(response.body); // Response body
```

In the above example, we pass a `Map` object as the `body` parameter, which contains the data we want to send to the API server.

## Handling Errors

When working with network requests, it's crucial to handle errors gracefully. The `http` package provides methods like `get()` and `post()` that return a `http.Response` object. You can check the response's status code to determine if the request was successful or encountered an error.

```dart
http.Response response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/data'));
if (response.statusCode == 200) {
  // Request successful
  print(response.body);
} else {
  // Request failed
  print('Request failed with status code: ${response.statusCode}');
}
```

By checking the response's status code, you can take appropriate actions based on the outcome of the network request.

## Conclusion

Handling network requests in Flutter WebAssembly is essential for building dynamic web applications that interact with APIs. The `http` package provides a straightforward way to perform GET and POST requests, making it easy to fetch and submit data. By properly handling errors, you ensure that your application responds appropriately to different scenarios. Flutter WebAssembly unlocks the full potential of Flutter for web development, allowing developers to create fast and beautiful web applications with ease.
