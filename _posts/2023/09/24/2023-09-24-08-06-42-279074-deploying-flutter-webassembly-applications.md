With the introduction of Flutter 2.0, developers can now build web applications using Flutter's cross-platform framework. This means you can write code once and deploy it to multiple platforms, including the web. In this blog post, we will explore the process of deploying Flutter WebAssembly applications.

## What is WebAssembly?
WebAssembly, or Wasm for short, is a binary instruction format for executing code on the web. It allows developers to write high-performance applications that can run in a web browser, alongside classic web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Flutter WebAssembly takes advantage of this technology to enable the creation of web applications using Flutter.

## Prerequisites
Before deploying a Flutter WebAssembly application, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Flutter SDK installed.
2. Flutter version 2.0 or above.
3. A web browser that supports WebAssembly, such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

## Building the Flutter WebAssembly Application
To start, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your Flutter project directory. Run the following command to enable Flutter Web support:

`flutter config --enable-web`

Next, build your Flutter application as you normally would using the following command:

`flutter build web`

This command compiles your Dart code into WebAssembly and generates the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for your web application.

## Deploying the Application
Once the build process is complete, you can deploy your Flutter WebAssembly application to any web server or hosting platform of your choice. Here are a few options to consider:

1. **GitHub Pages**: If you have a GitHub repository for your project, you can host your web application using GitHub Pages. Simply push your generated `web` folder to a `gh-pages` branch, and GitHub will automatically build and host your application.

2. **Netlify**: Netlify is a popular hosting platform that supports static websites, including Flutter WebAssembly applications. You can easily deploy your application by linking your repository and specifying the build command as `flutter build web`.

3. **Firebase Hosting**: Firebase Hosting provides a simple way to deploy your web applications. By linking your Flutter project to Firebase and using the Firebase CLI, you can deploy your application with a single command.

## Conclusion
Deploying Flutter WebAssembly applications opens up new possibilities for building high-performance web applications. With the ability to write code once and deploy it to multiple platforms, Flutter developers can reach a larger audience and provide a consistent user experience across different devices. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily deploy your Flutter WebAssembly application to your preferred hosting platform and start sharing your creation with the world.
