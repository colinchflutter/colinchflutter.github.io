SQLite is a widely used database engine that provides a lightweight and efficient way to store and manage data. In Flutter, the `sqflite` package is a popular choice for working with SQLite databases. As your app evolves, there may be situations where you need to make changes to the database schema, such as adding new tables or modifying existing ones. In such cases, it's important to handle SQLite version upgrades properly to ensure a seamless transition for your users. In this article, we will discuss how to handle version upgrades in Flutter with `sqflite`.

## Understanding the Basics

Before we dive into version upgrades, let's quickly recap the basics of using `sqflite` in Flutter. To begin with, you need to define a database helper class that extends the `DatabaseOpenHelper` class provided by `sqflite`. This class handles opening and upgrading the database, among other things.

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

class MyDatabase extends DatabaseOpenHelper {
  static final int _version = 1;
  static final String _databaseName = 'my_database.db';

  MyDatabase() : super(_databaseName, _version);

  @override
  void onCreate(Database db, int version) {
    // Create your initial database schema here
    db.execute('CREATE TABLE ...');
  }

  @override
  void onUpgrade(Database db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {
    // Handle schema changes for different versions
    if (oldVersion < 2) {
        // Perform necessary database upgrades
        db.execute('ALTER TABLE ...');
    }
  }
}
```

In the example above, we have defined a custom `MyDatabase` class that extends `DatabaseOpenHelper`. We pass the database name and initial version number to the superclass constructor. The `onCreate` method is called when the database is first created, allowing you to define the initial schema. The `onUpgrade` method is called whenever a version upgrade is required.

## Handling Version Upgrades

To handle version upgrades, you need to override the `onUpgrade` method in your database helper class. This method is called whenever the database version is incremented. Inside this method, you can write the necessary code to upgrade the schema based on the current and new version numbers.

In our example above, we demonstrated a simple upgrade scenario where we perform a database alteration if the old version is less than 2. You can modify this logic based on the specific changes you need to make in your database schema.

```dart
  @override
  void onUpgrade(Database db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {
    if (oldVersion < 2) {
        db.execute('ALTER TABLE ...');
    }
    
    if (oldVersion < 3) {
        db.execute('CREATE TABLE ...');
    }
    
    // Handle other version-specific upgrades if necessary
  }
```

By implementing the `onUpgrade` method, you ensure that the necessary changes are made to the database schema whenever a version upgrade occurs. This allows your app to seamlessly transition to the new version without losing any data.

## Conclusion

Handling SQLite version upgrades is an essential part of maintaining a Flutter app that uses a SQLite database. By leveraging the `onUpgrade` method provided by the `sqflite` package, you can easily make changes to the database schema and ensure a smooth upgrade process for your users. Always remember to increment the version number whenever you make changes to the schema and define the corresponding upgrade logic in the `onUpgrade` method.
