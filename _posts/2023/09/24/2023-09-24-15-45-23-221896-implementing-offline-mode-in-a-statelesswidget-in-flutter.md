In today's world, having offline functionality in a mobile application is essential to provide a seamless user experience. Flutter, a cross-platform framework for building mobile apps, offers a simple and effective way to implement offline mode in your application.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement offline mode in a `StatelessWidget` in Flutter using the `connectivity` package.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following installed:

- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- Text editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

## Installing Package

Before we can start implementing offline mode, we need to install the `connectivity` package. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
flutter pub add connectivity
```

This command adds the `connectivity` package as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file and downloads it.

## Implementing Offline Mode

1. First, import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:connectivity/connectivity.dart';
```

2. Create a class that extends `StatelessWidget`:

```dart
class OfflineModeExample extends StatelessWidget {
  const OfflineModeExample({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      child: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Offline Mode Example',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Add a member variable that will track the network connectivity state:

```dart
class OfflineModeExample extends StatelessWidget {
  final Connectivity _connectivity = Connectivity();
```

4. Create a method to check if the device is currently online or offline:

```dart
Future<bool> _isOnline() async {
  var connectivityResult = await _connectivity.checkConnectivity();
  return connectivityResult != ConnectivityResult.none;
}
```

5. Modify the `build` method to conditionally display the online/offline status:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return FutureBuilder<bool>(
    future: _isOnline(),
    builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot<bool> snapshot) {
      if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
        return CircularProgressIndicator();
      } else if (snapshot.data!) {
        return Container(
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'You are online',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
        );
      } else {
        return Container(
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'You are offline',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
            ),
          ),
        );
      }
    },
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented offline mode in a `StatelessWidget` in Flutter using the `connectivity` package. Now your application can provide a seamless experience to users even when they are offline.

By incorporating offline functionality, you can improve user engagement and ensure your app remains usable in various scenarios.

Remember to handle exceptions and edge cases according to your specific requirements. Happy offline coding! ðŸ“±ðŸ’»
