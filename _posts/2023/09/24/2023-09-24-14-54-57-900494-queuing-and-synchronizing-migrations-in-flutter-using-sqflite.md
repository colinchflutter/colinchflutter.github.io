Migrations are an essential part of managing the database schema in any app. In Flutter, the `sqflite` package is commonly used for local database operations. However, when dealing with database migrations, it's crucial to ensure that the migrations are applied in the correct order and without conflicts.

In this article, we will explore how to queue and synchronize migrations in Flutter using the `sqflite` package.

## Why do we need to queue migrations?

Imagine you are working on a team where multiple developers are constantly making changes to the database schema. Each developer might create a migration file to update the schema as needed. However, if multiple migrations are executed simultaneously, conflicts can arise, leading to data corruption or inconsistencies.

To avoid such conflicts, it's important to queue and synchronize the migrations so that they are applied in order, one after another.

## Using a migration queue in Flutter

To implement a migration queue in Flutter, we can use a simple approach:

1. Create a table to keep track of the applied migrations.
2. Store the migration history in a table column.
3. Compare the list of applied migrations with the available migrations and apply the pending ones.

Let's dive into the implementation steps.

1. Create a migration history table:
   ```dart
   final migrationTable = '''
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS migration_history (
         id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
         migration TEXT
      )
   ''';
   ```

2. Keep track of the applied migrations:
   ```dart
   Future<void> saveMigration(String migration) async {
      final db = await openDatabase('your_database.db');
      await db.execute('INSERT INTO migration_history (migration) VALUES (?)', [migration]);
   }
   ```

3. Compare and apply pending migrations:
   ```dart
   Future<void> applyMigrations() async {
      final db = await openDatabase('your_database.db');
      final appliedMigrations = await db.query('migration_history');

      final availableMigrations = [
         'migration1',
         'migration2',
         'migration3'
      ];

      final pendingMigrations = availableMigrations.where((migration) =>
         !appliedMigrations.contains(migration)
      );

      for (final migration in pendingMigrations) {
         // Run your migration code here
         // ...
         await saveMigration(migration); // Save the applied migration
      }
   }
   ```

By following this approach, you can ensure that migrations are applied in the correct order one at a time, eliminating potential conflicts.

## Conclusion

Applying migrations in the correct order is crucial for maintaining a consistent and stable database schema in Flutter apps. By implementing a migration queue using the `sqflite` package, you can effectively manage and avoid conflicts when multiple migrations are being applied.

Remember to always queue and synchronize your migrations to ensure a smooth and error-free database schema evolution.
