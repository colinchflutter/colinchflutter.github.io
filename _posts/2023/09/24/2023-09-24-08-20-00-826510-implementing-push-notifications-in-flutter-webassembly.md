With the increasing popularity of web applications, Flutter now supports the compilation of applications to WebAssembly (Wasm). This means we can build and run Flutter apps directly in the browser, allowing for a seamless web experience.

One important feature that many web applications utilize is push notifications. Implementing push notifications in Flutter Wasm is quite similar to implementing them in regular Flutter apps. Here's a step-by-step guide to adding push notifications to your Flutter Wasm application:

### Step 1: Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

To enable push notifications, we need to use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) as our notification service provider. 

1. Create a new project in the Firebase console.
2. Register your web app and follow the setup instructions, such as adding the generated configuration to your Flutter Wasm project.

### Step 2: Request user permission

To send push notifications, we need user permission. Add the following code to prompt the user for permission:

```dart
// Import the required packages
import 'package:firebase/firebase.dart' as firebase;

// Request permission and initialize Firebase messaging
void initializeMessaging() {
  firebase.messaging().requestPermission();
}
```

### Step 3: Handling notification messages

When a notification is received, we need to handle it accordingly. Add the following code to handle incoming messages:

```dart
// Import the required packages
import 'package:firebase/firebase.dart' as firebase;

// Handle incoming messages
void handleIncomingMessages() {
  firebase.messaging().onMessage.listen((firebaseMessage) {
    // Do something with the received message
    print(firebaseMessage.notification.title);
    print(firebaseMessage.notification.body);
  });
}
```

### Step 4: Displaying notifications

To display notifications in the browser, we need to use the `showNotification()` method provided by the browser's `Notification` API. Add the following code to display notifications when a message is received:

```dart
import 'dart:html';

// Show notification
void showNotification(String title, String body) {
  Notification(title, options: {
    'body': body,
  });
}
```

### Step 5: Testing push notifications

To test push notifications, send a notification from the Firebase console by selecting your app and clicking on "Cloud Messaging" in the left menu. Compose and send a message, and it should be received by your Flutter Wasm app.

### Conclusion

Adding push notification support to a Flutter Wasm app is quite straightforward, thanks to Firebase Cloud Messaging. By incorporating push notifications, you can enhance the user experience and keep users engaged with real-time updates and important announcements.
