Search functionality is a common requirement in many Flutter applications. In this article, we will explore how to implement search functionality in a StatelessWidget in Flutter.

## Step 1: Create a new StatefulWidget

First, we need to create a new StatefulWidget that will hold the state of the search functionality. We will call this widget `SearchWidget`. 

```dart
class SearchWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  const SearchWidget({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _SearchWidgetState createState() => _SearchWidgetState();
}

class _SearchWidgetState extends State<SearchWidget> {
  String _searchTerm = '';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        TextField(
          onChanged: (value) {
            setState(() {
              _searchTerm = value;
            });
          },
        ),
        Text('Search term: $_searchTerm'),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, we have created a Stateful Widget `SearchWidget` which holds the state of the search term input. Whenever the user types in the TextField, the `onChanged` callback is triggered, updating the `_searchTerm` variable and triggering a rebuild of the widget.

## Step 2: Using `SearchWidget` in a StatelessWidget

Now, let's use the `SearchWidget` in a StatelessWidget. We will call this widget `HomeScreen`.

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomeScreen({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Search Demo'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          const SizedBox(height: 16),
          const SearchWidget(),
          const SizedBox(height: 16),
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: 10,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text('Item $index'),
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the `HomeScreen` widget, we include the `SearchWidget` inside a `Column`, followed by a `ListView.builder` to display a list of items.

## Conclusion

By following the above steps, you can easily implement search functionality in a StatelessWidget in Flutter. The `SearchWidget` holds the state of the search term, while the `HomeScreen` widget incorporates the `SearchWidget` and displays the search results.

With this implementation, users can search for specific items within the list, improving the usability and user experience of your Flutter application.
