## What are Transitions?

Transitions are animations that occur when navigating between different screens or routes in an app. By default, Flutter provides a set of predefined transitions such as fade, slide, and scale. However, for more complex animations, you may need to create custom transitions.

## Creating a Custom Transition

To create a custom transition, you will need to use the `PageRouteBuilder` class provided by Flutter. This class allows you to define various properties of the transition, such as duration, curve, and builder function.

Here's an example of how to create a custom slide transition from right to left:

```dart
class SlideTransitionRoute<T> extends PageRouteBuilder<T> {
  final Widget page;

  SlideTransitionRoute({required this.page})
      : super(
          pageBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation) => page,
          transitionsBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation, child) {
            var begin = Offset(1.0, 0.0);
            var end = Offset.zero;
            var tween = Tween(begin: begin, end: end);
            var curvedAnimation = CurvedAnimation(
              parent: animation,
              curve: Curves.ease,
            );
            return SlideTransition(
              position: tween.animate(curvedAnimation),
              child: child,
            );
          },
        );
}
```

In the above code snippet, we define a custom `SlideTransitionRoute` class that extends `PageRouteBuilder`. The `page` parameter is the widget that we want to transition to.

Inside the `transitionsBuilder` function, we create a `Tween` that defines the movement of the transition from `begin` position (right side of the screen) to `end` position (left side of the screen). We then use a `CurvedAnimation` to apply an easing curve to the transition.

Finally, we wrap the `child` widget in a `SlideTransition` widget and pass the tween animation to the `position` property to perform the slide animation.

## Implementing the Custom Transition

To use the custom transition, you can simply wrap the widget you want to navigate to in a `GestureDetector` and navigate to the new screen using `Navigator.push`.

```dart
class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: GestureDetector(
          onTap: () {
            Navigator.push(
              context,
              SlideTransitionRoute(page: SecondScreen()),
            );
          },
          child: Text('Tap to navigate to second screen'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we wrap the `Text` widget in a `GestureDetector` and provide it the `onTap` callback. When the user taps on the text, it will navigate to the `SecondScreen` using our custom slide transition.

## Conclusion

Custom transitions can greatly enhance the user experience in your Flutter app by adding visually appealing animations when navigating between screens. By using the `PageRouteBuilder` class and defining the desired animation properties, you can easily create and implement custom transitions in a `StatelessWidget`.
