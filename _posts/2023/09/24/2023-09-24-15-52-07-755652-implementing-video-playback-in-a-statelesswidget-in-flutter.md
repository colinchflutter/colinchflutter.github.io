Flutter is a powerful framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. One common requirement in many mobile apps is the ability to play videos. In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement video playback in a `StatelessWidget` in Flutter.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine. You can check the installation by running `flutter doctor` in your terminal.

## Getting Started
To start, create a new Flutter project and open the main.dart file. We will be using the `video_player` package to handle video playback.

## Step 1: Add the Dependencies
Add the `video_player` dependency to your project by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yaml
dependencies:
  video_player: ^2.2.5
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to download it.

## Step 2: Import the Required Packages
In your main.dart file, import the necessary packages:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';
```

## Step 3: Create a VideoPlayerWidget
Inside your main.dart file, create a new class called `VideoPlayerWidget`:
```dart
class VideoPlayerWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final String videoUrl;

  VideoPlayerWidget({required this.videoUrl});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    VideoPlayerController _controller = VideoPlayerController.network(videoUrl);
    _controller.initialize();

    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: AspectRatio(
          aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
          child: VideoPlayer(_controller),
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          _controller.value.isPlaying ? _controller.pause() : _controller.play();
        },
        child: Icon(
          _controller.value.isPlaying ? Icons.pause : Icons.play_arrow,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the `VideoPlayerWidget`, we are creating a `VideoPlayerController` with the provided `videoUrl` and initializing it. We then use the `VideoPlayer` widget to display the video. The `floatingActionButton` allows the user to play or pause the video.

## Step 4: Use the VideoPlayerWidget
To use the `VideoPlayerWidget`, simply create a new instance of it and provide the `videoUrl`:
```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text("Video Player"),
        ),
        body: VideoPlayerWidget(
          videoUrl: "https://www.example.com/video.mp4",
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Replace the `videoUrl` with the URL of the video you want to play.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to implement video playback in a `StatelessWidget` in Flutter using the `video_player` package. By following these steps, you can easily integrate video playback into your Flutter app. Happy coding!
