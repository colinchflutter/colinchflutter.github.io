Migrating data from one table to another is a common task when working with databases in Flutter. Flutter migrations allow you to modify your database schema over time while preserving existing data.

In this blog post, we'll walk through the process of migrating data from one table to another using Flutter migrations. We'll assume you have basic knowledge of Flutter and SQLite.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

1. Flutter installed on your machine.
2. A Flutter project set up with SQLite database integration.
3. A basic understanding of Flutter migrations.

## Step 1: Create the New Table

The first step is to create the new table that will hold the migrated data. Open your migration file (`xxx_create_new_table.dart`) and add the table creation code. Here's an example:

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

class CreateNewTableMigration {
  final Database database;

  CreateNewTableMigration(this.database);

  Future<void> migrate() async {
    await database.execute('''
      CREATE TABLE new_table (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        name TEXT,
        age INTEGER
      )
    ''');
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Migrate the Data

Next, we need to migrate the data from the old table to the new table. To do this, open your migration file (`xxx_migrate_data.dart`) and add the data migration code. Here's an example:

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

class MigrateDataMigration {
  final Database database;

  MigrateDataMigration(this.database);

  Future<void> migrate() async {
    List<Map<String, dynamic>> oldTableData = await database.query('old_table');

    for (var data in oldTableData) {
      await database.insert('new_table', data);
    }

    await database.delete('old_table');
  }
}
```
## Step 3: Run the Migrations

Now that we have the migration files ready, we need to run them. Open your `main.dart` file and add the code to run the migrations:

```dart
import 'package:path/path.dart';
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

Future<void> runMigrations() async {
  final databasePath = await getDatabasesPath();
  final database = await openDatabase(join(databasePath, 'your_database.db'));

  await CreateNewTableMigration(database).migrate();
  await MigrateDataMigration(database).migrate();

  await database.close();
}
```

Call the `runMigrations()` function wherever you want to execute the migrations, such as in the `initState()` method of your app's main widget.

## Conclusion

Migrating data from one table to another is a crucial part of managing database schema changes in Flutter applications. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily migrate your data using Flutter migrations.

Remember to always backup your database before running migrations to avoid data loss.
