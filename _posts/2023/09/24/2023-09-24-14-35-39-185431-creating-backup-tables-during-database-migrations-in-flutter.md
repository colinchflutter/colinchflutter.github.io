As your Flutter app evolves, you may find the need to make changes to your database schema. This could involve adding, modifying, or deleting tables or columns. However, when performing such migrations, it is important to take precautions to ensure that your data is not lost. One way to achieve this is by creating backup tables during the migration process.

In this article, we will discuss how to create backup tables in Flutter database migrations using the `sqflite` package. Let's get started!

## 1. Import the necessary packages

First, make sure you have the `sqflite` and `path` packages added as dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file. Then, import them in your migration script.

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';
import 'package:path/path.dart';
```

## 2. Define a Backup Table

Next, you need to define a backup table that will hold the data from the original table during the migration process. This table will have the same structure as the original table.

```dart
Future<void> _createBackupTable(Database db) async {
  await db.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS backup_table (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      name TEXT,
      age INTEGER
    )
  ''');
}
```

In this example, we are creating a backup table called `backup_table` with three columns: `id`, `name`, and `age`. Adjust the table structure to match your specific needs.

## 3. Copy Data to Backup Table

Once the backup table is created, you can copy the data from the original table to the backup table. This can be done using a simple SQL query.

```dart
Future<void> _copyDataToBackupTable(Database db) async {
  await db.execute('INSERT INTO backup_table SELECT * FROM original_table');
}
```

Replace `original_table` with the name of the table you want to create a backup of.

## 4. Perform Database Migration

Finally, you can perform the database migration by making the necessary changes to the original table.

```dart
void _performMigration(Database db) async {
  await _createBackupTable(db);
  await _copyDataToBackupTable(db);

  // Make necessary changes to the original table.
  await db.execute('ALTER TABLE original_table ADD COLUMN new_column TEXT');
  await db.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS unused_table');
}
```

In this example, we are adding a new column to the `original_table` using the `ALTER TABLE` SQL statement and dropping an unused table using the `DROP TABLE` SQL statement. Adjust the migration steps according to your requirements.

## Conclusion

Creating backup tables during database migrations in Flutter can help prevent data loss during schema changes. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily create backup tables, copy data to them, and perform the necessary database migrations. Remember to always test your migrations thoroughly before deploying them to a production environment.
