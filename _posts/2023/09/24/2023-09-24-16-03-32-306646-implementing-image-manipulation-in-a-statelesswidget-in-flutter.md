Flutter provides a powerful framework for building cross-platform applications, including image manipulation capabilities. In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of implementing image manipulation in a `StatelessWidget` in Flutter.

## Adding Dependencies

Before we start, let's add the required dependencies to our `pubspec.yaml` file:

```
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_picker: ^0.8.4
  image: ^3.1.2
```

Next, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the packages.

## Implementation Steps

1. Import the required packages in your Flutter file:

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_picker/image_picker.dart';
import 'package:image/image.dart' as img;
```

2. Create a `StatelessWidget` and define a function to pick an image from the device's gallery:

```dart
class ImageManipulationWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  Future<File?> pickImageFromGallery() async {
    final picker = ImagePicker();
    final pickedFile = await picker.getImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
    if (pickedFile != null) {
      return File(pickedFile.path);
    }
    return null;
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Widget implementation
  }
}
```

3. Add a method to manipulate the selected image. In this example, we'll resize the image to a specific width and height:

```dart
void manipulateImage(File imageFile) {
  img.Image image = img.decodeImage(imageFile.readAsBytesSync())!;
  img.Image resizedImage = img.copyResize(image, width: 300, height: 300);

  // Do further operations on the resized image if needed

  // Save the manipulated image to disk
  File manipulatedImage = File('path/to/save/image.jpg');
  manipulatedImage.writeAsBytesSync(img.encodeJpg(resizedImage));
}
```

4. Update the `build` method to include a button to pick an image and invoke the image manipulation method:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('Image Manipulation'),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: () async {
          File? pickedImage = await pickImageFromGallery();
          if (pickedImage != null) {
            manipulateImage(pickedImage);
          }
        },
        child: Text('Pick Image'),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

5. Run the app on a device or emulator and test the image manipulation functionality.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to implement image manipulation in a `StatelessWidget` using Flutter. By leveraging the `image_picker` and `image` packages, we can easily create apps that can pick images from the device's gallery and perform various manipulations on them. This opens up a wide range of possibilities for image editing and enhancement in Flutter applications.
