Are you developing a Flutter application that uses the `sqflite` package for database management? If so, you might have come across the need to track the migration history of your database. Tracking migration history is essential when you need to make changes to your database schema over time and ensure seamless upgrades for your users. In this blog post, we will explore how you can keep track of migration history using the `sqflite` package in Flutter.

## What is a database migration?

A database migration is a process of applying changes to a database schema. It typically involves adding, modifying, or deleting tables, columns, or indexes. Migrations are necessary when you want to evolve your database structure without losing data or breaking existing functionality.

In a Flutter application, you can use the `sqflite` package to interact with a SQLite database. `sqflite` provides a powerful set of APIs for database CRUD operations. However, it does not include built-in support for tracking migration history.

## Why track migration history?

Tracking migration history allows you to:

1. Ensure seamless database upgrades for your users: By keeping track of migration history, you can apply database schema changes incrementally, ensuring a smooth user experience without the risk of data loss or downtime.
2. Rollback to a previous version: If you encounter any issues after applying a migration, having migration history allows you to revert the changes and roll back to a previous version of the database schema.
3. Collaborate with other developers: Migration history provides a log of all the changes made to the database schema, making it easier to collaborate with other developers working on the project.

## Implementing migration history tracking

To track migration history in the `sqflite` package, you can create a separate table in your database to store migration information. Here's an example of how you can structure your migration history table:

```dart
CREATE TABLE migrations (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  version INTEGER,
  migration_date TEXT
)
```
The `migrations` table will have the following columns:
- `id`: An auto-incrementing integer that serves as the primary key for each migration entry.
- `version`: An integer representing the version of the database schema after the migration.
- `migration_date`: A timestamp indicating when the migration was applied.

Whenever you perform a migration, you can insert a new entry into the `migrations` table to record the changes. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```dart
await db.transaction((txn) async {
  await txn.execute('ALTER TABLE my_table ADD COLUMN new_column TEXT');

  // Insert migration entry into migrations table
  await txn.rawInsert('INSERT INTO migrations (version, migration_date) VALUES (?, ?)', [2, DateTime.now().toString()]);
});
```

By inserting a new row into the `migrations` table, you can keep track of the version of the database schema and the date of the migration.

## Querying migration history

To query the migration history, you can use the `sqflite` package's `query` method. Here's an example of how you can retrieve all migration entries:

```dart
Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> getMigrationHistory(Database db) async {
  return await db.rawQuery('SELECT * FROM migrations');
}
```

By calling this method and iterating through the returned list of maps, you can access all the migration entries in your database.

## Conclusion

Tracking migration history is an essential aspect of managing database schema changes in Flutter applications that use the `sqflite` package. By implementing a separate table to store migration information, you can ensure seamless upgrades, easily roll back changes if needed, and collaborate effectively with other developers.

Remember, always maintain a backup of your database before performing any migrations, and handle versioning carefully to ensure data integrity and a smooth user experience.
