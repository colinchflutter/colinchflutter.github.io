In Flutter, a StatelessWidget is a type of widget that does not hold any mutable state. It is ideal for building simple UI components that don't change dynamically.

When building a responsive layout in Flutter, you can utilize the MediaQuery class to retrieve information about the current device's size, orientation, and other metrics. By using this information, you can adjust the layout accordingly.

Here's an example of building a responsive layout using a StatelessWidget in Flutter:

```
class MyResponsiveLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Responsive Layout'),
      ),
      body: Container(
        child: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text(
                'Welcome to My App',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24.0),
              ),
              SizedBox(height: 20.0),
              _buildResponsiveContent(),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  Widget _buildResponsiveContent() {
    double deviceWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;

    if (deviceWidth > 600) {
      return Text(
        'Large Screen Layout',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18.0),
      );
    } else {
      return Text(
        'Small Screen Layout',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 12.0),
      );
    }
  }
}
```

In the example above, we created a StatelessWidget called `MyResponsiveLayout`. It contains a Scaffold widget with an AppBar and a body that holds a Container with a Column as its child.

Inside the Column, we have a centered Text widget with the text "Welcome to My App", followed by SizedBox for spacing. The `_buildResponsiveContent` method is then called to render different content based on the device's width.

Using the `MediaQuery.of(context).size.width` property, we obtain the device's width and conditionally render different Text widgets based on its value. In this example, if the width is greater than 600, it displays "Large Screen Layout", otherwise it shows "Small Screen Layout".

By leveraging the MediaQuery class and the concept of StatefulWidget, you can create responsive layouts in Flutter that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. This allows for a seamless user experience across multiple devices.
