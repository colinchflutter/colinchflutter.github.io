In Flutter, **screen orientation changes** can affect the layout and UI rendering of your app. It's important to handle these changes properly to ensure your app looks and functions correctly in both portrait and landscape modes. In this blog post, we'll discuss how to handle screen orientation changes in a `StatelessWidget` in Flutter.

## Detecting screen orientation changes

To handle screen orientation changes, Flutter provides the `OrientationBuilder` widget. This widget rebuilds itself whenever the screen orientation changes, allowing you to update the UI accordingly.

To detect screen orientation changes in a `StatelessWidget`, wrap your UI code with the `OrientationBuilder` widget. Here's an example of how to use it:

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return OrientationBuilder(
      builder: (BuildContext context, Orientation orientation) {
        // Update UI based on screen orientation
        if (orientation == Orientation.portrait) {
          // Render portrait mode UI
          return Container(
            child: Text('Portrait mode'),
          );
        } else {
          // Render landscape mode UI
          return Container(
            child: Text('Landscape mode'),
          );
        }
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In the above example, we create an `OrientationBuilder` widget and provide a callback function that takes the `BuildContext` and `Orientation` as parameters. Inside the callback, we can conditionally render different UI based on the current screen orientation.

## Updating the UI on orientation change

To update the UI when the screen orientation changes, we need to rebuild certain parts of the widget tree. In the example above, we conditionally render different UI based on the screen orientation. When the orientation changes, the `OrientationBuilder` widget will rebuild itself, and the UI will be updated accordingly.

**Note**: If you have complex UIs with multiple nested widgets, you may need to update other parts of the widget tree as well. You can achieve this by using `setState` or state management solutions like `Provider` or `Bloc` pattern.

## Conclusion

Handling screen orientation changes is essential for ensuring a smooth user experience in your Flutter app. By using the `OrientationBuilder` widget, you can easily detect and update the UI based on the screen orientation. Remember to update the necessary parts of the widget tree to reflect the new orientation.

Implementing proper handling for orientation changes will make your app more versatile and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience for your users in both portrait and landscape modes.
