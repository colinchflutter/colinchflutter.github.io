Flutter is a popular cross-platform development framework that allows developers to build beautiful and performant applications for various platforms including Android, iOS, web, and desktop. With the introduction of Flutter WebAssembly, developers can now target modern web browsers and deploy their Flutter applications on the web.

Real-time communication is an essential feature of many applications, enabling users to interact with each other in real-time. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement real-time communication in Flutter WebAssembly using websockets.

## What are websockets?

Websockets provide a bidirectional communication channel between a client and a server over a single unencrypted TCP connection. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which are stateless and require the client to initiate a new request for every server response, websockets allow for ongoing, real-time communication.

## Implementing Websockets in Flutter WebAssembly

To implement real-time communication using websockets in Flutter WebAssembly, we can make use of the `web_socket_channel` package, which provides a way to establish a websocket connection and communicate with the server.

### Installing the package

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  web_socket_channel: ^2.1.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

### Establishing a websocket connection

```dart
import 'package:web_socket_channel/html.dart';

final channel = HtmlWebSocketChannel.connect('wss://your-websocket-url');
```

Replace `'wss://your-websocket-url'` with the URL of your websocket server. Make sure to use `'wss://'` for secure connections and `'ws://'` for non-secure connections.

### Sending and receiving messages

To send a message to the server:

```dart
channel.sink.add('Hello, server!');
```

To listen for messages from the server:

```dart
channel.stream.listen((message) {
  print('Received: $message');
});
```

### Closing the websocket connection

When you no longer need the websocket connection, make sure to close it to free up system resources:

```dart
channel.sink.close();
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement real-time communication in Flutter WebAssembly using websockets. By leveraging the `web_socket_channel` package, we can establish a websocket connection, send and receive messages, and close the connection when necessary.

Websockets offer a powerful way to build real-time applications in Flutter WebAssembly, empowering developers to create engaging experiences for their users. Whether it's a chat application, multiplayer game, or collaborative editing tool, real-time communication is now within reach with Flutter WebAssembly.
