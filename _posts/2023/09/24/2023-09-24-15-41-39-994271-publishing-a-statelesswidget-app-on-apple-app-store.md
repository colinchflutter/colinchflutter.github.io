If you have developed a mobile application using StatelessWidget in Flutter and want to publish it on the Apple App Store, this guide will walk you through the necessary steps. Here's a step-by-step process to help you get started:

## 1. Create an Apple Developer Account
To publish your app on the Apple App Store, you will need an Apple Developer Account. Visit the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/) and sign up for an account if you don't have one already. Follow the instructions and pay the necessary fees to enroll as an Apple developer.

## 2. Prepare your App for Submission
Before submitting your StatelessWidget app, make sure you have taken care of the following:

- Test your app thoroughly on iOS devices and ensure that it is stable and free from bugs.
- Optimize the performance and user experience of your app.
- Add an app icon and properly set up the app's metadata, such as the app name, description, screenshots, and keywords.
- Check your app against the App Store Review Guidelines to ensure compliance.

## 3. Generate an Archive of Your App
In Flutter, you can generate an archive of your iOS app by running the following command in your project directory:

```bash
flutter build ios
```

This command compiles your code, builds the app bundle, and generates the required archive.

## 4. Create an App Store Connect Record
App Store Connect is Apple's platform for managing app submissions. Here's how you can create a new record for your app:

- Log in to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) using your Apple Developer Account credentials.
- Go to "My Apps" and click the "+" button to add a new app.
- Provide all the necessary details, including the app's name, bundle identifier, and version number.
- Make sure to select the appropriate options for app availability, content rights, and pricing.

## 5. Upload Your App Archive
Once you have created a record for your app on App Store Connect, you can proceed to upload your app archive:

- Select your app from the "My Apps" list in App Store Connect.
- Click on "App Store Connect Resources" and then "App Store Connect API Keys."
- Generate an API key and download it.
- Install a macOS app distribution certificate and provisioning profile on your computer.
- Open Xcode, go to "Window" -> "Organizer," select "Archives," and choose the latest archive of your app.
- Click the "Distribute App" button and follow the instructions to upload your app archive to App Store Connect.

## 6. Submit for Review
After uploading your app archive, you can submit it for review by Apple:

- Go to your app's page on App Store Connect.
- Click on "App Store Connect API Keys" and use your previously generated API key to create a new key for distributing the app.
- Provide required details such as contact information, app review information, and other applicable app details.
- Confirm the submission and wait for Apple's review process to complete.

## Conclusion
Publishing a StatelessWidget app on the Apple App Store involves a few important steps, including creating an Apple Developer Account, preparing your app for submission, generating an app archive, creating an App Store Connect record, uploading your app archive, and submitting it for review. By following this guide, you'll be well on your way to making your app available to millions of users on the App Store!
