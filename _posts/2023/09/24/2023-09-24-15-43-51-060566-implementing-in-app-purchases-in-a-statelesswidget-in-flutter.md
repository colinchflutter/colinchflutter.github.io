In-app purchases are a popular revenue-generating feature in mobile applications. Flutter, being a versatile cross-platform framework, provides a straightforward way to integrate in-app purchases into your app. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement in-app purchases in a StatelessWidget in Flutter.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the implementation, make sure you have the following setup:

- A Flutter development environment.
- A Firebase project with Firestore enabled.
- The `firebase_auth` and `cloud_firestore` dependencies added to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

## Setting up in-app purchases

To use in-app purchases in your Flutter app, you need to set up the necessary dependencies, add your products, and handle the purchase flow.

### Adding dependencies

First, add the `in_app_purchase` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  in_app_purchase: ^0.5.2
```

### Configuring products

To configure your in-app purchase products, create a file called `iap_config.dart`. You can define your products as constants using their respective product IDs:

```dart
const String premiumProductId = 'com.example.premium';
// Add more product IDs if needed
```

### Initializing the plugin

In the entry point of your app (e.g. `main.dart`), add the following code to initialize the in-app purchase plugin:

```dart
Future<void> initInAppPurchases() async {
  final bool isAvailable = await InAppPurchaseConnection.instance.isAvailable();

  if (isAvailable) {
    final ProductDetailsResponse response =
        await InAppPurchaseConnection.instance.queryProductDetails(<String>[premiumProductId]);
    if (response.notFoundIDs.isNotEmpty) {
      // Handle not found IDs
    }

    final List<ProductDetails> products = response.productDetails;

    for (ProductDetails product in products) {
      // Use the product details as needed
    }
  } else {
    // In-app purchases not available
  }
}
```

### Making a purchase

To initiate a purchase, create a method in your `StatelessWidget` that calls the `buyNonConsumable` method:

```dart
Future<void> purchasePremium() async {
  final PurchaseParam purchaseParam = PurchaseParam(
    productDetails: products.firstWhere((product) => product.id == premiumProductId),
  );
  await InAppPurchaseConnection.instance.buyNonConsumable(purchaseParam: purchaseParam);
}
```

### Handling purchases

To handle purchases, create a listener in your `StatelessWidget`:

```dart
void _listenToPurchaseUpdated(List<PurchaseDetails> purchaseDetailsList) {
  for (PurchaseDetails purchaseDetails in purchaseDetailsList) {
    switch (purchaseDetails.status) {
      case PurchaseStatus.purchased:
        // Process the purchase
        break;
      case PurchaseStatus.error:
        // Handle purchase error
        break;
      case PurchaseStatus.restored:
        // Process restored purchases
        break;
      case PurchaseStatus.pending:
        // Handle pending purchases
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement in-app purchases in a StatelessWidget in Flutter. We covered the necessary steps to set up the in-app purchase dependencies, configure the products, initialize the plugin, make a purchase, and handle the purchase flow. With these integration steps, you can easily monetize your app through in-app purchases.
