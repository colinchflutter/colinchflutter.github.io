## Introduction
Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. With Flutter, developers can create high-performance and visually appealing user interfaces.

When it comes to developing web applications with Flutter, there are two options available: Flutter Web and Flutter WebAssembly. In this blog post, we will explore the differences between these two approaches.

## Flutter Web
Flutter Web allows developers to write web applications using the same codebase and programming language (Dart) as they would for mobile applications. The main difference is the rendering engine used - instead of relying on native widgets, Flutter Web uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render the UI components.

Some key features of Flutter Web include:
- Fast and smooth user experience with hot-reload support for quicker iteration cycles.
- The ability to create complex and custom UI components using the same declarative UI syntax as Flutter for mobile.
- Seamless integration with existing web technologies and frameworks.
- Access to the vast ecosystem of Flutter packages and plugins.

Flutter Web is a powerful option for developers who want to leverage their existing Flutter skills and codebase to build web applications without having to learn new technologies. However, it should be noted that Flutter Web has some limitations, such as a larger package size and slightly reduced performance compared to native web frameworks.

## Flutter WebAssembly
Flutter WebAssembly takes a different approach to building web applications with Flutter. It compiles the Flutter code to WebAssembly, a binary format that can be run in modern web browsers without the need for JavaScript.

Some advantages of Flutter WebAssembly include:
- Improved performance compared to Flutter Web, as WebAssembly code can be executed directly in the browser.
- Reduced package size compared to Flutter Web, as there is no need to bundle a JavaScript runtime.
- Ability to access browser APIs and use JavaScript interop to interact with existing web technologies.

However, it's important to note that Flutter WebAssembly is still in its early stages of development and may not have the same level of stability and feature support as Flutter Web. Additionally, compatibility with older web browsers may be limited due to the requirement for WebAssembly support.

## Conclusion
Both Flutter Web and Flutter WebAssembly offer powerful ways to build web applications with Flutter. Flutter Web allows developers to leverage their existing Flutter skills and codebase, while Flutter WebAssembly provides improved performance and reduced package size.

The choice between Flutter Web and Flutter WebAssembly depends on the specific requirements of your project and the trade-offs you are willing to make. It's important to assess the performance needs, package size constraints, and browser compatibility requirements before making a decision.
