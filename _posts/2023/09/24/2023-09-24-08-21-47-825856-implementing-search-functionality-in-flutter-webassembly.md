Flutter WebAssembly is a powerful framework that allows developers to build web applications using the Flutter framework. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement search functionality in a Flutter WebAssembly application.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have Flutter SDK and Flutter Web support installed on your machine. You can follow the official Flutter documentation for installation instructions.

## Setting up the project

1. Create a new Flutter Web project by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```shell
   flutter create my_search_app
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.

3. Edit the `pubspec.yaml` file to include the `flutter_search_bar` package, which provides search functionality components for Flutter.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_search_bar: ^0.3.2
   ```

4. Save the `pubspec.yaml` file and run the following command in your terminal to fetch the package:

   ```shell
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Implementing the search bar

1. Replace the code in the `lib/main.dart` file with the following code:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:flutter_search_bar/flutter_search_bar.dart';

   void main() {
     runApp(MyApp());
   }

   class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return MaterialApp(
         title: 'Search App',
         theme: ThemeData(
           primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
         ),
         home: HomePage(),
       );
     }
   }

   class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _HomePageState createState() => _HomePageState();
   }

   class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
     SearchBar searchBar;

     AppBar buildAppBar(BuildContext context) {
       return AppBar(
         title: Text('Search App'),
         actions: [
           searchBar.getSearchAction(context),
         ],
       );
     }

     void onSubmitted(String value) {
       // Handle search query here
       print('Search query: $value');
     }

     _HomePageState() {
       searchBar = SearchBar(
         onSubmitted: onSubmitted,
         inBar: false,
         buildDefaultAppBar: buildAppBar,
       );
     }

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: searchBar.build(context),
         body: Center(
           child: Text('Implement search functionality here.'),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

2. Save the file and run the application using the following command:

   ```shell
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

   This will launch the Flutter Web application in Chrome.

3. You should see a search bar in the app's AppBar. Typing in the search bar and hitting Enter will print the search query to the console.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to implement search functionality in a Flutter WebAssembly application. We used the `flutter_search_bar` package to add a search bar to the AppBar and handle search query submissions. With this knowledge, you can now enhance your Flutter Web applications with powerful search capabilities.
