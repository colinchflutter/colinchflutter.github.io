In Flutter, scroll physics are used to control the scrolling behavior of widgets that support scrolling, such as ListView, SingleChildScrollView, and Scrollable. The built-in scroll physics provided by Flutter are powerful, but sometimes we may need to create custom scroll physics to achieve specific effects.

In this blog post, we will discuss how to create custom scroll physics for two popular animation widgets in Flutter: RotationTransition and SizeTransition.

## Custom Scroll Physics for RotationTransition

RotationTransition is a widget that animates its child by rotating it. By default, when the child exceeds the boundaries of its parent, it will be clipped. However, we may want to create a scrollable rotation effect, where the child rotates based on the scroll position.

To achieve this, we can create a custom scroll physics class that extends the ClampingScrollPhysics or BouncingScrollPhysics, depending on the desired behavior. We can then override the ```applyPhysicsToUserOffset``` method to control the rotation based on the scroll position.

```dart
class CustomRotationScrollPhysics extends ClampingScrollPhysics {
  CustomRotationScrollPhysics({ScrollPhysics parent}) : super(parent: parent);

  @override
  CustomRotationScrollPhysics applyTo(ScrollPhysics ancestor) {
    return CustomRotationScrollPhysics(parent: buildParent(ancestor));
  }

  @override
  double applyPhysicsToUserOffset(ScrollMetrics position, double offset) {
    final double rotationFactor = 0.02; // Adjust the rotation speed as desired
    final double rotation = rotationFactor * offset;
    // Apply rotation to the child based on the rotation value
    // code for rotating the child goes here
    return super.applyPhysicsToUserOffset(position, offset);
  }
}
```

To use this custom scroll physics with the RotationTransition widget, we can pass it to the physics property of a Scrollable widget, such as ListView or SingleChildScrollView.

```dart
Scrollable(
  physics: CustomRotationScrollPhysics(),
  child: RotationTransition(
    // rotation transition code goes here
  ),
);
```

## Custom Scroll Physics for SizeTransition

SizeTransition is a widget that animates its child by changing its size. By default, the size transition only occurs within the boundaries of the parent widget. However, we may want to create a scrollable size effect, where the child can be resized based on the scroll position.

To achieve this, we can create a custom scroll physics class, similar to the one we created for RotationTransition. We can override the ```applyPhysicsToUserOffset``` method to control the size transformation based on the scroll position.

```dart
class CustomSizeScrollPhysics extends ClampingScrollPhysics {
  CustomSizeScrollPhysics({ScrollPhysics parent}) : super(parent: parent);

  @override
  CustomSizeScrollPhysics applyTo(ScrollPhysics ancestor) {
    return CustomSizeScrollPhysics(parent: buildParent(ancestor));
  }

  @override
  double applyPhysicsToUserOffset(ScrollMetrics position, double offset) {
    final double scaleFactor = 0.01; // Adjust the scale factor as desired
    final double scale = 1.0 + scaleFactor * offset;
    // Apply scale to the child based on the scale value
    // code for resizing the child goes here
    return super.applyPhysicsToUserOffset(position, offset);
  }
}
```

To use this custom scroll physics with the SizeTransition widget, we can pass it to the physics property of a Scrollable widget, such as ListView or SingleChildScrollView.

```dart
Scrollable(
  physics: CustomSizeScrollPhysics(),
  child: SizeTransition(
    // size transition code goes here
  ),
);
```

## Conclusion

Creating custom scroll physics for widgets like RotationTransition and SizeTransition can add interesting and interactive effects to your Flutter applications. By extending the existing scroll physics classes and overriding the appropriate methods, you can achieve the desired behavior that goes beyond the default capabilities.

Utilizing custom scroll physics allows us to create unique animations and user experiences, enhancing the overall look and feel of our Flutter applications.
