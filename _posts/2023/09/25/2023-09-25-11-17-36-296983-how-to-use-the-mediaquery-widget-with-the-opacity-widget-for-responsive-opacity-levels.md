In Flutter, you can create responsive opacity levels using the `MediaQuery` widget combined with the `Opacity` widget. This allows you to adjust the opacity of a widget based on the screen size or other media queries.

Here's an example of how you can implement this technique:

## Step 1: Import the necessary packages

First, import the required packages for Flutter:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

## Step 2: Define the responsive opacity widget

Create a new widget that uses the `MediaQuery` widget to get the screen size and adjusts the opacity accordingly:

```dart
class ResponsiveOpacity extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget child;
  final double opacity;

  const ResponsiveOpacity({Key? key, required this.child, required this.opacity})
      : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Opacity(
      opacity: _getOpacity(context),
      child: child,
    );
  }

  double _getOpacity(BuildContext context) {
    final screenSize = MediaQuery.of(context).size;
    // Define your opacity levels based on screen size or any other media queries you need
    if (screenSize.width < 600) {
      return 0.5;
    } else {
      return opacity;
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Use the responsive opacity widget

Now, you can use the `ResponsiveOpacity` widget in your application, wrapping any widget you want to adjust the opacity for:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      // ...
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: ResponsiveOpacity(
            opacity: 0.8,
            child: Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 200,
              color: Colors.blue,
              child: Text(
                'Responsive Opacity',
                style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the example above, the opacity of the `Container` widget is set to `0.8` by default, but if the screen width is less than `600`, it will be set to `0.5` instead.

That's it! You have now implemented a responsive opacity level using the `MediaQuery` widget with the `Opacity` widget in Flutter.

Remember to adjust the opacity levels and media queries according to your specific needs to achieve the desired effect.
