To create a ghosting effect with the `Opacity` widget, follow these steps:

1. Import the required Flutter package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   ```

2. Create a `StatefulWidget` or `StatelessWidget` to define your user interface. In this example, we'll use a `StatefulWidget`:
   ```dart
   class GhostingEffect extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _GhostingEffectState createState() => _GhostingEffectState();
   }
   
   class _GhostingEffectState extends State<GhostingEffect> {
     double _opacityLevel = 1.0;
     
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(
           title: Text('Ghosting Effect'),
         ),
         body: Center(
           child: Column(
             mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
             children: [
               Opacity(
                 opacity: _opacityLevel,
                 child: Image.asset('assets/ghost.png'),
               ),
               SizedBox(height: 20),
               RaisedButton(
                 onPressed: () {
                   setState(() {
                     _opacityLevel = _opacityLevel == 1.0 ? 0.5 : 1.0;
                   });
                 },
                 child: Text(_opacityLevel == 1.0 ? 'Fade Out' : 'Fade In'),
               ),
             ],
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

3. Create an instance of `MaterialApp` and pass the `GhostingEffect` widget as the `home` parameter:
   ```dart
   void main() {
     runApp(MaterialApp(
       home: GhostingEffect(),
     ));
   }
   ```

In this example, we use the `Opacity` widget with an `Image.asset` as its child widget. The `opacity` property of the `Opacity` widget determines the transparency level, where 1.0 is fully visible and 0.0 is completely transparent.

By pressing the `Fade Out` or `Fade In` button, the `_opacityLevel` state variable is updated, causing the `Opacity` widget to rebuild and animate the ghosting effect.

By following these steps, you can easily create a ghosting effect using the `Opacity` widget in Flutter. Enjoy experimenting with different opacity levels and integrate the effect into your own Flutter applications.
