In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio time-stretching using the phase vocoder algorithm in Flutter Sound. Audio time-stretching allows us to change the tempo of an audio file without affecting its pitch. It is a useful technique in various audio applications such as music production, audio editing, and more.

## What is the Phase Vocoder algorithm?

The phase vocoder algorithm is a digital signal processing technique used for time-stretching and pitch-shifting audio signals. It divides the audio signal into overlapping frames, performs spectral analysis on each frame using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and then modifies the phase information of the FFT bins to stretch or compress the audio in the time domain. By doing this, the algorithm can alter the tempo of the audio while preserving the original pitch.

## Implementing time-stretching in Flutter Sound

Flutter Sound is a powerful audio recording and playback library for Flutter that provides various functionalities for manipulating audio data. To implement time-stretching using the phase vocoder algorithm in Flutter Sound, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Retrieve the audio data**: First, we need to retrieve the audio data from the desired source, whether it's a local file or a network stream. Flutter Sound provides APIs for reading audio data from different sources, allowing us to retrieve the audio data as raw PCM samples.

2. **Apply the phase vocoder algorithm**: Once we have the audio data, we can apply the phase vocoder algorithm to stretch or compress the audio in the time domain. Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to apply the phase vocoder algorithm using Flutter Sound:

   ```dart
   // Assuming we have the audio data stored in a buffer called 'audioData'

   // Create a Flutter Sound instance
   final flutterSound = FlutterSound();

   // Configure the phase vocoder parameters
   final frameSize = 1024;
   final hopSize = 256;
   final stretchFactor = 1.5; // Change this value to adjust time-stretching

   // Create a phase vocoder instance
   final phaseVocoder = PhaseVocoder(frameSize, hopSize);

   // Process the audio data frame by frame
   for (int i = 0; i < audioData.length; i += hopSize) {
     final frame = audioData.sublist(i, i + frameSize);

     // Apply time-stretching using the phase vocoder
     final stretchedFrame = phaseVocoder.processFrame(frame, stretchFactor);

     // Write the processed frame to output or playback
     // (e.g., using flutterSound.writeChunk/studio.playChunk)
   }
   ```

3. **Save or play the processed audio**: After processing each frame, you can choose to save the processed audio to a file or play it back in real-time. Flutter Sound offers APIs for writing audio data to a file or playing it back using audio devices.

## Conclusion

Time-stretching is a powerful audio processing technique that allows us to manipulate the tempo of audio signals without affecting their pitch. By implementing the phase vocoder algorithm in Flutter Sound, we can leverage this technique in our Flutter applications. Whether you're building a music player, audio editing tool, or any other audio-related app, implementing audio time-stretching can enhance the user experience and provide new creative possibilities.
