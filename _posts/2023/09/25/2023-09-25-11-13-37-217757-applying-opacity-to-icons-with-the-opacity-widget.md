One way to achieve this effect is by using the Opacity widget, which is available in many UI framework libraries such as Flutter, React Native, and Angular. The Opacity widget allows you to adjust the transparency level of any child widget, including icons.

To apply opacity to an icon using the Opacity widget, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary packages or modules for working with icons and Opacity widget.
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```
2. Define your icon widget inside the build method of your Flutter widget. Let's assume we want to apply opacity to a `FontAwesome` icon.
```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Opacity(
    opacity: 0.7, // set the desired opacity level (between 0.0 and 1.0)
    child: Icon(
      FontAwesomeIcons.star, // replace with your desired icon
      size: 24, // set the desired icon size
    ),
  );
}
```
3. Customize the `opacity` property of the Opacity widget to adjust the transparency level of the icon. This property accepts a value between 0.0 (completely transparent) and 1.0 (completely opaque). For example, an opacity of 0.7 will make the icon 70% transparent.

By adjusting the opacity, you can create various visual effects such as faded icons, ghost-like icons, or icons that become more prominent when hovered or tapped.

Note: Applying opacity to icons can be done using different methods in various UI frameworks or libraries. The above example demonstrates how to accomplish this in Flutter, but similar approaches can be used in other frameworks as well.
