In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio timecode support in Flutter Sound. Flutter Sound is a powerful audio plugin for Flutter that allows you to record, play, and manipulate audio files. Adding timecode support to audio files can be useful in various scenarios, such as syncing audio with video or creating timestamped annotations.

## What is timecode?

Timecode is a way of representing time in the form of hours, minutes, seconds, and frames. It provides a standardized way to synchronize different media sources, such as audio and video files. Timecode is commonly used in the film, television, and broadcast industries.

## Adding timecode support to Flutter Sound

1. **Import the necessary dependencies**
   
   First, we need to import the necessary packages for Flutter Sound and timecode manipulation. In your `pubspec.yaml` file, include the following dependencies:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter_sound: ^0.6.0
     timecode: ^2.0.0
   ```

2. **Create a timecode class**
   
   Next, create a `Timecode` class that represents the timecode value for audio files. This class can be used for creating, parsing, and manipulating timecode values.

   ```dart
   import 'package:timecode/timecode.dart';
   
   class AudioTimecode {
     Timecode startTimecode;
     Timecode endTimecode;
   
     AudioTimecode(this.startTimecode, this.endTimecode);
   
     factory AudioTimecode.fromMilliseconds(int startMs, int endMs) {
       var startTimeInSeconds = startMs / 1000.0;
       var endTimeInSeconds = endMs / 1000.0;
   
       var startTimecode = Timecode.fromSeconds(startTimeInSeconds);
       var endTimecode = Timecode.fromSeconds(endTimeInSeconds);
   
       return AudioTimecode(startTimecode, endTimecode);
     }
   
     // Other methods for timecode manipulation can be added here
   }
   ```

3. **Use timecode with Flutter Sound**
   
   Now, we can use the `AudioTimecode` class with Flutter Sound to add timecode support to audio files. For example, when recording audio, we can store the start and end timecodes along with the recorded audio file.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';
   
   Future<void> startRecordingWithTimecode() async {
     // Start recording audio
     String audioPath = await FlutterSound.startRecorder(null);
   
     // Get the start and end timecodes
     int startMs = DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch;
   
     // ... (code for recording audio)
   
     int endMs = DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch;
     AudioTimecode audioTimecode = AudioTimecode.fromMilliseconds(startMs, endMs);
   
     // Save the audio file along with the timecode
     // (e.g., store in a database or metadata of the audio file)
   }
   ```

   Similarly, we can use timecode when playing audio files to seek to a specific timecode position or display the current timecode position.

   ```dart
   Future<void> playAudioWithTimecode() async {
     // Get the start and end timecodes of the audio file
     AudioTimecode audioTimecode = // ... (fetch timecode from database or metadata)
     
     // Convert timecode to milliseconds
     int startMs = audioTimecode.startTimecode.totalMilliseconds.floor();
   
     // ... (code for playing audio and seeking to the startMs position)
   
     // Update the UI with the current timecode position
     while (await FlutterSound.isPlaying()) {
       double currentPositionMs = // ... (get the current position in milliseconds)
       Timecode currentPositionTimecode = audioTimecode.startTimecode.addMilliseconds(currentPositionMs.toInt());
   
       // Update the UI with the currentPositionTimecode
     }
   }
   ```

## Conclusion

By adding timecode support to audio files in Flutter Sound, we can enhance the functionality of our audio applications. Timecode allows for precise synchronization and manipulation of audio files, opening up possibilities for various use cases. With the integration of the `timecode` package, it is straightforward to work with timecode values in Flutter Sound applications.
