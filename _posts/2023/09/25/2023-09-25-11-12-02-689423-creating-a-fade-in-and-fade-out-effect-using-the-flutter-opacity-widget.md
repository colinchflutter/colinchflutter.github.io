In Flutter, you can easily create a fade-in and fade-out effect using the Opacity widget. The Opacity widget allows you to adjust the transparency of its child widget, which can be used to animate the fading effect.

To create a fade-in effect, you can gradually increase the opacity of a widget from 0.0 to 1.0 over a certain period of time. Conversely, to create a fade-out effect, you can gradually decrease the opacity from 1.0 to 0.0.

Here's an example of how you can use the Opacity widget to create a fade-in and fade-out effect:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class FadeInFadeOutExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FadeInFadeOutExampleState createState() => _FadeInFadeOutExampleState();
}

class _FadeInFadeOutExampleState extends State<FadeInFadeOutExample> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  AnimationController _controller;
  Animation<double> _animation;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    _controller = AnimationController(
      vsync: this,
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
    );

    _animation = CurvedAnimation(
      parent: _controller,
      curve: Curves.easeIn,
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Fade-In / Fade-Out Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: FadeTransition(
          opacity: _animation,
          child: Container(
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
            color: Colors.blue,
          ),
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          _controller.forward(from: 0.0);
        },
        child: const Icon(Icons.play_arrow),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(home: FadeInFadeOutExample()));
}
```

In this example, we first import the necessary dependencies. Then we create a stateful widget called `FadeInFadeOutExample`. Inside the widget, we define an `AnimationController` and an `Animation<double>`. The `AnimationController` controls the duration and state of the animation, while the `Animation<double>` defines the range of opacity values.

In the `initState` method, we initialize the animation controller and the curved animation, specifying the duration and the curve of the animation. In the `build` method, we use the `FadeTransition` widget along with the `Opacity` animation to animate the opacity of the `Container` widget.

Finally, we define a `FloatingActionButton` to trigger the animation when pressed. By calling `_controller.forward(from: 0.0)`, we start the animation from the initial value of 0.0 to the final value of 1.0, thus creating a fade-in effect.

This is a simple example of how you can create a fade-in and fade-out effect using the Flutter Opacity widget. Experiment with different durations and curves to achieve your desired fading animation.
