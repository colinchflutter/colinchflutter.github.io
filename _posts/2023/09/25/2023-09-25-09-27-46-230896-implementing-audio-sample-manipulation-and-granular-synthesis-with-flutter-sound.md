Flutter Sound is a powerful audio plugin for Flutter that allows you to record, play, and process audio. In this blog post, we will explore how to use Flutter Sound for audio sample manipulation and granular synthesis, which can be used to create interesting audio effects and music.

## What is audio sample manipulation?

Audio sample manipulation refers to the process of modifying the individual samples of an audio waveform. This can include operations such as changing the pitch, altering the volume, applying filters, or creating loops and repetitions. By manipulating audio samples, you can achieve a wide range of sound effects and transformations.

## Getting started with Flutter Sound

Before we dive into audio sample manipulation and granular synthesis, let's start by setting up Flutter Sound in a Flutter project.

1. Add the Flutter Sound dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_sound: ^X.X.X
```

2. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the dependency.

3. Import the Flutter Sound package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';
```

4. Initialize the Flutter Sound instance:

```dart
FlutterSound flutterSound = FlutterSound();
```

## Audio sample manipulation

To perform audio sample manipulation using Flutter Sound, we will focus on two main operations: changing the pitch and altering the volume of an audio sample.

### Changing the pitch

To change the pitch of an audio sample, we can use the `setPitch` method provided by Flutter Sound. The `setPitch` method takes two parameters: the audio path and the target pitch shift value.

```dart
await flutterSound.setPitch(audioPath, pitchShift);
```

### Altering the volume

To alter the volume of an audio sample, we can use the `setVolume` method provided by Flutter Sound. The `setVolume` method takes two parameters: the audio path and the target volume level.

```dart
await flutterSound.setVolume(audioPath, volumeLevel);
```

## Granular synthesis

Granular synthesis is a technique that involves breaking down an audio sample into tiny "grains" and reassembling them in different ways to create unique sound textures and effects. Flutter Sound provides the necessary methods to implement granular synthesis in Flutter.

### Playing a grain

To play a grain of an audio sample, we can use the `startPlayerFromBuffer` method provided by Flutter Sound. This method allows us to specify the audio buffer and the desired start and end positions within the buffer.

```dart
await flutterSound.startPlayerFromBuffer(
  buffer,
  startFrame,
  endFrame,
  codec: Codec.pcm16,
  numChannels: 1,
  sampleRate: 44100,
);
```

### Modulating grain parameters

To create interesting granular synthesis effects, we can modulate the grain parameters such as the start and end positions, duration, pitch, and volume. We can achieve this by applying mathematical functions or random values to these parameters.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to implement audio sample manipulation and granular synthesis using Flutter Sound. You can use these techniques to create unique sound effects, music, and audio applications. Experiment with different parameters and effects to unleash your creativity!
