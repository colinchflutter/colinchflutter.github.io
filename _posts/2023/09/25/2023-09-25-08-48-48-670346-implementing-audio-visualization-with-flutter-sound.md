Flutter Sound is a powerful audio player and recorder plugin for Flutter that offers various features like playing audio from local files, assets, and network, recording audio, and audio visualization. In this tutorial, we will focus on implementing audio visualization with Flutter Sound.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you need to have Flutter and the Flutter Sound package installed.

### 1. Add Flutter Sound to your pubspec.yaml file:
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_sound: ^8.1.4
```

### 2. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

## Setting Up the Audio Player
First, we need to set up the audio player using the Flutter Sound package. We will create an instance of the `FlutterSoundPlayer` class and initialize it in our Flutter app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';

FlutterSoundPlayer _audioPlayer = FlutterSoundPlayer();
```

To load and play an audio file, you can use the `_audioPlayer.startPlayer` method. For example:

```dart
Future<void> playAudio(String filePath) async {
  await _audioPlayer.startPlayer(path: filePath);
}
```

## Implementing Audio Visualization
Now that we have set up the audio player, let's move on to implementing audio visualization.
