In Flutter, you can achieve adaptive and responsive opacity changes using the `MediaQuery` and `AnimatedOpacity` widgets. The `MediaQuery` widget allows you to obtain information about the current device's screen size, while the `AnimatedOpacity` widget allows you to animate the opacity of a widget.

## Step 1: Import the necessary packages

First, ensure that you have the necessary packages imported in your Flutter project. 
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

## Step 2: Set up the MediaQuery widget

The `MediaQuery` widget provides several methods to obtain information about the current device's screen size. You can use the `MediaQuery.of(context)` method to access the `MediaQueryData` object, which contains properties like `size`, `devicePixelRatio`, and more.

```dart
final MediaQueryData _mediaQueryData = MediaQuery.of(context);
final double screenWidth = _mediaQueryData.size.width;
final double screenHeight = _mediaQueryData.size.height;
```

## Step 3: Calculate the desired opacity value

Based on the screen size, you can calculate the desired opacity value. For example, you may want to set the opacity to 0.5 for small devices and 1.0 for larger devices.

```dart
double getOpacityValue() {
  if (screenWidth < 600) {
    return 0.5;
  } else {
    return 1.0;
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Use the AnimatedOpacity widget

The `AnimatedOpacity` widget allows you to animate the opacity of a widget. It takes the `opacity` property, which you can set based on the calculated value from `getOpacityValue()`.

```dart
AnimatedOpacity(
  opacity: getOpacityValue(),
  duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  child: Container(
    // Your widget here
  ),
)
```

## Step 5: Wrap your widget with the MediaQuery widget

To ensure that your `AnimatedOpacity` widget is responsive, wrap it with the `MediaQuery` widget. This will ensure that the widget is rebuilt whenever the screen size changes.

```dart
return MediaQuery(
  data: _mediaQueryData,
  child: AnimatedOpacity(
    opacity: getOpacityValue(),
    duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500),
    child: Container(
      // Your widget here
    ),
  ),
);
```

And that's it! You have now set up the `MediaQuery` and `AnimatedOpacity` widgets to achieve responsive opacity changes in Flutter.
