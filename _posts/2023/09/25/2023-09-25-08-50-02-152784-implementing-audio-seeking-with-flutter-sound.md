In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement audio seeking functionality using the Flutter Sound package. Seeking allows users to jump to a specific position in an audio file, which can be useful for skipping or replaying sections of audio.

## Getting Started
To get started, make sure you have Flutter and the Flutter Sound package installed in your development environment. You can find the installation instructions in the [Flutter Sound documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_sound).

## Implementing Audio Seeking
1. Start by importing the necessary packages and initializing the Flutter Sound instance in your Flutter widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';

class AudioPlayerWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AudioPlayerWidgetState createState() {
    return _AudioPlayerWidgetState();
  }
}

class _AudioPlayerWidgetState extends State<AudioPlayerWidget> {
  FlutterSoundPlayer _audioPlayer;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _audioPlayer = FlutterSoundPlayer();
  }
  
  // ...
}
```

2. Next, load your audio file using the `audioPlayer.open(Audio)`, where `Audio` is the path to your audio file:

```dart
  // ...
  
  Future<void> _loadAudio() async {
    await _audioPlayer.open(Audio('path_to_audio_file'));
  }
  
  // ...
```

3. Now, you can implement the seeking functionality by using the `audioPlayer.seek(double)` method to jump to a specific position in the audio file. For example, you can add a slider widget to allow users to select a desired position:

```dart
  // ...
  
  double _position = 0;
  
  // ...
  
  Future<void> _seekAudio(double position) async {
    await _audioPlayer.seek(position);
    
    setState(() {
      _position = position;
    });
  }
  
  // ...
  
  // Use a Slider widget to allow users to select the position
  Slider(
    value: _position,
    min: 0,
    max: _audioPlayer.duration,
    onChanged: (value) {
      _seekAudio(value);
    },
  ),
  
```

4. Remember to update the position when the audio is playing so that the slider reflects the current position:

```dart
  // ...
  
  StreamSubscription<PlaybackStatus> _playbackSubscription;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _audioPlayer = FlutterSoundPlayer();
    _playbackSubscription = _audioPlayer.onPlayerStateChanged.listen((event) {
      setState(() {
        _position = event.position;
      });
    });
  }
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    super.dispose();
    _playbackSubscription.cancel();
    _audioPlayer.closeAudio();
  }
  
  // ...
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to implement audio seeking functionality using Flutter Sound. Now you can allow users to jump to a specific position in an audio file within your Flutter application. Happy coding!
