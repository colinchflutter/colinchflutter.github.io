Opacity animations are commonly used to show or hide UI elements in a smooth and visually appealing way. However, if you want to create a more sophisticated effect, such as partial opacity or masking, you'll need to combine the `ClipRect` and `AnimatedOpacity` widgets in Flutter.

The `ClipRect` widget is used to clip its child to a specific rectangular area. On the other hand, the `AnimatedOpacity` widget animates the opacity of its child from 0.0 to 1.0 over a given duration.

To achieve a masked opacity animation, you can wrap the child widget with the `ClipRect` widget and animate the opacity with the `AnimatedOpacity` widget. Here's an example code snippet in Dart:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MaskedOpacityAnimation extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MaskedOpacityAnimationState createState() => _MaskedOpacityAnimationState();
}

class _MaskedOpacityAnimationState extends State<MaskedOpacityAnimation> {
  double _opacity = 0.0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onTap: () {
        setState(() {
          _opacity = _opacity == 0.0 ? 1.0 : 0.0;
        });
      },
      child: Center(
        child: ClipRect(
          child: AnimatedOpacity(
            opacity: _opacity,
            duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500),
            child: Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 200,
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Masked Opacity Animation'),
      ),
      body: MaskedOpacityAnimation(),
    ),
  ));
}
```

In this example, we create a `MaskedOpacityAnimation` widget as a StatefulWidget. We use a `GestureDetector` to toggle the `_opacity` state variable on tap. This triggers the animation to show or hide the child widget.

The child widget is wrapped with the `ClipRect` widget to clip it to the specified area. Inside `ClipRect`, we use the `AnimatedOpacity` widget. We pass the desired opacity value to the `opacity` parameter and set the duration for the animation. The child of `AnimatedOpacity` is a simple `Container` with a blue color.

When you run this code, tapping on the container will animate its opacity, giving a masked opacity effect.

By combining the `ClipRect` and `AnimatedOpacity` widgets, you can create engaging masked opacity animations that can be used to reveal or hide certain parts of your UI. Experiment with different child widget sizes and shapes to achieve unique effects in your Flutter apps.
