## Introduction
Audio noise can be a common problem when working with audio recordings. It can be caused by various factors such as background noise, microphone interference, or poor recording conditions. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio noise reduction using Flutter Sound, a versatile audio recording and playback library for Flutter.

## What is Flutter Sound?
Flutter Sound is a powerful audio package for Flutter that provides a comprehensive set of APIs for recording, playing, and manipulating audio files. It offers a range of features including audio recording, playback, streaming, and more. With the help of Flutter Sound, we can easily incorporate audio noise reduction functionality into our Flutter applications.

## Steps to implement audio noise reduction

### Step 1: Set up Flutter Sound
To get started, we need to add the Flutter Sound package to our Flutter project. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_sound: ^x.x.x  # Replace with the latest version
```

### Step 2: Import Flutter Sound
Import the necessary Flutter Sound packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';
```

### Step 3: Record audio
Use Flutter Sound to record an audio file. This can be done using the `FlutterSoundRecorder` class:

```dart
final FlutterSoundRecorder _recorder = FlutterSoundRecorder();
await _recorder.openAudioSession();
await _recorder.startRecorder(toFile: 'audio_record.aac', codec: Codec.aacADTS);
```

### Step 4: Apply audio noise reduction
Once the audio recording is complete, we can apply audio noise reduction using Flutter Sound's built-in functions. First, load the recorded audio file using the `FlutterSoundPlayer` class:

```dart
final FlutterSoundPlayer _player = FlutterSoundPlayer();
await _player.openAudioSession();
await _player.startPlayer(fromURI: 'audio_record.aac');
```

Next, apply the noise reduction filter to the audio file:

```dart
await _player.setFilter(FilterType.noiseReduction);
```

### Step 5: Save the processed audio
Finally, save the processed audio file to a new file using Flutter Sound:

```dart
await _player.saveToFile(newFilePath: 'audio_record_filtered.aac', codec: Codec.aacADTS);
```

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we have explored how to implement audio noise reduction using Flutter Sound. By leveraging the powerful audio functionalities provided by Flutter Sound, we can easily record, process, and save audio recordings with reduced noise. With this knowledge, you can enhance the audio quality of your Flutter applications and provide a better user experience.
