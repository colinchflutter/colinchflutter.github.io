Opacity is a property that allows us to adjust the transparency level of a widget. The Opacity widget takes a child widget as its parameter and applies the desired opacity to it.

To begin, let's assume that we have a ListView widget that needs to have a transparent effect. Here's an example of how to apply opacity to a scrollable widget:

```dart
Opacity(
  opacity: 0.5, // set the desired opacity value between 0.0 and 1.0
  child: ListView.builder(
    itemCount: 10,
    itemBuilder: (context, index) {
      return ListTile(
        title: Text('Item $index'),
      );
    },
  ),
)
```
In the code above, we wrapped the ListView.builder widget with the Opacity widget. We set the opacity value to 0.5, which means the ListView will be 50% transparent. Adjust this value according to your design needs.

Remember to import the necessary dependencies in your pubspec.yaml file. In this case, we are assuming that you have already added the necessary dependencies for building a Flutter app.

Keep in mind that applying opacity to a widget may affect not only its content but also its child widgets. If you need to apply opacity only to the content of the scrollable widget while keeping its child widgets unaffected, you can use the Container widget to wrap the content and apply opacity to it.

Now you know how to apply opacity to a scrollable widget in Flutter using the Opacity widget. Experiment with different opacity values to achieve the desired visual effect in your app.
