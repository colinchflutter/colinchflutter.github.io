Audio watermarking is a technique used to embed a unique identifier into an audio file for copyright protection purposes. This identifier can be used to track the origin of the file and prevent unauthorized use.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio watermarking using Flutter Sound - a powerful audio plugin for Flutter applications. This technique can be applied to various types of audio files, such as music tracks, podcasts, or any other audio content.

## What is Flutter Sound?

[Flutter Sound](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_sound) is a Flutter plugin that provides a simple way to record and play audio in Flutter applications. It offers a wide range of features, including recording, playback, audio visualization, and more.

## Steps to Implement Audio Watermarking with Flutter Sound

**Step 1: Generate Watermark**

The first step is to generate a unique watermark, which will be embedded into the audio file. This watermark can be generated using various algorithms, such as a hash function, or it can be a custom string. The watermark should be unique and hard to predict or modify.

```
import 'package:crypto/crypto.dart';
import 'dart:convert';

String generateWatermark(String data) {
  var bytes = utf8.encode(data); // Convert data to bytes
  var digest = sha256.convert(bytes); // Generate hash

  return digest.toString(); // Return the watermark as a string
}
```

**Step 2: Embed Watermark into Audio File**

Next, we need to embed the watermark into the audio file. Flutter Sound provides methods to record and save audio files. We can use those methods to save the audio file with the watermark embedded in it.

```
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';

void embedWatermark(String audioFilePath, String watermark) async {
  var watermarkBytes = utf8.encode(watermark); // Convert watermark to bytes

  var audioFile = FlutterSound().openAudioSession(); // Open audio session

  audioFile.startRecorder(toFile: audioFilePath); // Start recording audio

  audioFile.setCallback((e) {
    if (e.current?.position == -1) {
      return;
    }

    var combinedData = List<int>.from(e.buffer); // Convert audio buffer to list of bytes
    combinedData.addAll(watermarkBytes); // Append watermark to audio data

    // Save the combined audio file with the watermark embedded
    FlutterSound().writeAudioToFile(combinedData, audioFilePath);
  });

  // Stop recording after a certain duration
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 10));
  audioFile.stopRecorder();
}
```

**Step 3: Verify Watermark**

Finally, we need to implement a verification mechanism to check if the audio file has been tampered with or not. This can be done by extracting the watermark from the audio file and comparing it with the original watermark.

```
bool verifyWatermark(String audioFilePath, String originalWatermark) {
  var audioData = FlutterSound().readAllBytes(audioFilePath); // Read all bytes from the audio file

  // Extract watermark from audio data
  var extractedWatermark = String.fromCharCodes(audioData.sublist(audioData.length - originalWatermark.length));

  return extractedWatermark == originalWatermark; // Compare extracted watermark with original
}
```

## Conclusion

By implementing audio watermarking using Flutter Sound, we can add an extra layer of protection to our audio files. This technique allows us to track the origin of the file, prevent unauthorized use, and protect our copyrighted content.

Remember to always handle audio watermarking in a secure manner and consider additional security measures if required. With Flutter Sound's capabilities, we can easily incorporate audio watermarking into our Flutter applications and ensure the safety of our audio content.
