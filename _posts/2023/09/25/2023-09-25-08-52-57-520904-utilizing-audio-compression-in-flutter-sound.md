Audio compression is an essential aspect of any audio application, as it helps reduce the file size without compromising the audio quality significantly. In Flutter, a popular cross-platform framework for building mobile and web applications, the Flutter Sound package provides a convenient way to work with audio files. In this blog post, we'll explore how to utilize audio compression in Flutter Sound to optimize audio files.

## Why compress audio files?

Audio files, such as music or voice recordings, can consume a significant amount of storage space, especially when dealing with longer durations or multiple files. Compressing audio files helps reduce their size, making them more manageable to store and transmit over networks. It is particularly important when working with mobile applications that have limited storage capacity.

## Using the Flutter Sound package

To utilize audio compression in Flutter Sound, we need to have the package included in our project. Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_sound:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/dooboolab/flutter_sound.git
```

After running `flutter pub get`, you'll have the Flutter Sound package available in your project.

## Compressing audio files

To compress an audio file using Flutter Sound, we can make use of audio encoding formats like MP3 or AAC. These formats are commonly used for reducing file size while maintaining acceptable audio quality.

To start, we need to open the audio file using the `FlutterSoundPlayer` class and specify the desired audio format for compression. For example, let's compress an audio file to AAC format:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';

FlutterSoundPlayer _flutterSoundPlayer = FlutterSoundPlayer();

void compressAudio() async {
  try {
    await _flutterSoundPlayer.openAudioSession();
    
    // Specify the desired compression format - AAC
    await _flutterSoundPlayer.setSubscriptionDuration(const Duration(milliseconds: 10));
    await _flutterSoundPlayer.setAudioFormat(AudioFormat.aac);
  
    // Start playing source audio file
    await _flutterSoundPlayer.startPlayer('path_to_source_audio_file');
  
    // Prepare output compressed audio file
    await _flutterSoundPlayer.startRecorder('path_to_output_compressed_audio_file');
  
    // Wait until playback completes
    await _flutterSoundPlayer.onPlayerStateChanged
        .firstWhere((state) => state == PlayerState.STOPPED);
  
    // Stop recording and close session
    await _flutterSoundPlayer.stopRecorder();
    await _flutterSoundPlayer.closeAudioSession();
  
    print('Audio compression completed');
  } catch (e, stackTrace) {
    print('Error compressing audio: $e');
  }
}
```

In the above example, we open an audio session, set the subscription duration, and specify the audio format as AAC. We then start playing the source audio file and start recording the compressed audio file simultaneously. After the playback completes, we stop the recorder, close the audio session, and print a message indicating the completion of audio compression.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to utilize audio compression in Flutter Sound to optimize audio files. By compressing audio files, we can significantly reduce their size without sacrificing much in terms of audio quality. This is crucial for mobile applications that deal with audio files and have limited storage capacity. Flutter Sound package provides a straightforward way to incorporate audio compression into your Flutter projects, making it easier to manage and transmit audio files efficiently.
