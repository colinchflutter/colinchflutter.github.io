In this article, we will explore how to implement audio sound synthesis using oscillators in Flutter Sound. Sound synthesis refers to the process of generating audio signals artificially rather than playing pre-recorded sounds. Flutter Sound is a powerful audio package for Flutter that allows us to handle audio processing, playback, and recording tasks.

## Setting Up Flutter Sound

First, let's make sure Flutter Sound is properly set up in our Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_sound: ^2.1.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package's dependencies.

## Generating Sound with Oscillators

To generate sound, we will use the concept of oscillators. Oscillators are simple audio generators that produce waveforms of different shapes. Flutter Sound provides a `FlutterSoundOscillator` class to handle this.

Here's an example of generating a sine wave using an oscillator:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';

// Create an instance of the oscillator
var oscillator = FlutterSoundOscillator();

// Set the waveform type
oscillator.setWaveType(FlutterSoundOscillatorType.sine);

// Set the frequency (in Hz)
oscillator.setFrequency(440);

// Set the amplitude (from 0.0 to 1.0)
oscillator.setAmplitude(0.5);

// Start the oscillator
oscillator.start();
```

In the above example, we create an instance of the `FlutterSoundOscillator` class and set the waveform type to a sine wave using `setWaveType`. We define the frequency of the sine wave using `setFrequency` (in this case, 440 Hz, which is the musical note A4). We set the amplitude to 0.5 using `setAmplitude` to control the volume level of the generated sound. Finally, we start the oscillator with `start()`.

## Controlling Oscillator Parameters

To modify the parameters of the oscillator dynamically, we can use the provided setter methods. For example, to change the frequency or amplitude during runtime, we can call the corresponding setter methods like this:

```dart
// Change the frequency to 880 Hz (A5)
oscillator.setFrequency(880);

// Change the amplitude to 0.8
oscillator.setAmplitude(0.8);
```

By modifying these parameters, you can experiment with different waveforms and adjust the sound generated by the oscillator.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored how to implement audio sound synthesis using oscillators in Flutter Sound. We learned how to generate sound by setting up oscillators and controlling their parameters dynamically. With Flutter Sound, you can create custom audio sounds for your Flutter applications. Happy sound synthesis!
