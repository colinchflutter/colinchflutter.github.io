In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio beat matching and BPM detection using the Flutter Sound library. We will explain the concepts of beat matching and BPM detection, and then demonstrate step-by-step how to achieve this in a Flutter application.

Beat matching is a technique used by DJs to blend two or more tracks seamlessly by matching their beats. It involves adjusting the playback speed and aligning the beats of different tracks. BPM (Beats Per Minute) detection is the process of determining the tempo of a music track, measured in beats per minute.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have Flutter and Flutter Sound installed in your development environment.

## Setting up the Flutter Sound library

To use Flutter Sound in your Flutter application, you first need to import the library in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_sound: ^x.x.x  # Replace with the Flutter Sound version
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the library.

## Detecting BPM

Let's start by detecting the BPM of an audio file. For this, we will use a `Player` widget provided by Flutter Sound. Here's an example of how you can detect the BPM:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';

void detectBPM(String audioPath) async {
  FlutterSound flutterSound = FlutterSound();
  await flutterSound.openAudioSession();

  var info = await flutterSound.getInfo(audioPath);
  double bpm = info.bpm;

  print('BPM: $bpm');

  await flutterSound.closeAudioSession();
}
```

In this code snippet, we create an instance of `FlutterSound` and open an audio session. Then, we use the `getInfo` method to retrieve information about the audio file, including the BPM. Finally, we close the audio session.

## Implementing Beat Matching

To implement beat matching, we'll need to compare the beats of two audio tracks and adjust their playback speeds accordingly. Here's an example of how you can achieve this using Flutter Sound:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';

void beatMatching(String audioPath1, String audioPath2) async {
  FlutterSound flutterSound = FlutterSound();
  await flutterSound.openAudioSession();

  await flutterSound.startPlayer(audioPath1);
  await flutterSound.startPlayer(
    audioPath2,
    whenFinished: () {
      flutterSound.stopPlayer();
    },
  );
  
  // Adjust the playback speeds based on the beats
  // ...

  // Continue to play the tracks
  flutterSound.resumePlayer();

  await flutterSound.stopPlayer();
  await flutterSound.closeAudioSession();
}
```

In this code snippet, we open an audio session and start playing two audio tracks using the `startPlayer` method. We provide a callback function to the second track's `whenFinished` parameter, which stops the player when it finishes playing.

To implement beat matching, you would need to analyze the beats of each track and adjust their playback speeds accordingly. This part can be customized based on your specific requirements.

After adjusting the playback speeds, we resume the player to continue playing the tracks. Finally, we stop the player and close the audio session.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement audio beat matching and BPM detection using the Flutter Sound library. We learned how to detect the BPM of an audio file and how to implement beat matching by adjusting the playback speeds of multiple tracks.

Implementing audio beat matching and BPM detection can add a professional touch to your music-related Flutter applications. Using the Flutter Sound library, you can easily achieve these features and create immersive audio experiences.
