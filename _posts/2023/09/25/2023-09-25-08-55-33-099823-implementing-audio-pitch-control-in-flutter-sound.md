Flutter Sound is a powerful audio manipulation library for Flutter applications. It provides a wide range of features, including audio recording, playback, and streaming. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio pitch control using Flutter Sound.

## What is Audio Pitch Control?

Audio pitch control refers to the ability to change the pitch or frequency of an audio signal without affecting its duration. This can be useful in various applications such as music production, voice modulation, and sound effects implementation.

## Implementing Audio Pitch Control Using Flutter Sound

To implement audio pitch control in Flutter Sound, we need to make use of the `flutter_sound` package along with the `soundtouch` library.

1. Install the `flutter_sound` package by adding it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_sound: ^X.X.X
```

2. Import the necessary dependencies in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';
import 'package:soundtouch/soundtouch.dart';
```

3. Create an instance of the `FlutterSoundPlayer` class and initialize it:

```dart
final FlutterSoundPlayer _soundPlayer = FlutterSoundPlayer();
await _soundPlayer.openAudioSession();
```

4. Load the audio file that you want to manipulate:

```dart
await _soundPlayer.startPlayerFromUri(audioUrl);
```

5. Create an instance of the `SoundTouch` class and set the desired pitch shift:

```dart
final SoundTouch _soundTouch = SoundTouch();
_soundTouch.pitchSemi = 1.5; // Increase pitch by 1.5 semitones
```

6. Create a loop to process the audio frames and apply the pitch shift:

```dart
_soundPlayer.onProgress = (e) async {
  final bufferData = await _soundPlayer.audioSession!.getBuffer(e.position, e.duration);
  final processedData = _soundTouch.process(bufferData.buffer.asUint8List());

  // Play the processed audio
  await _soundPlayer.feedFromStream(processedData);
};
```

7. Start the audio playback and enjoy the pitch-shifted audio:

```dart
await _soundPlayer.setVolume(1);
await _soundPlayer.play();
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to implement audio pitch control using Flutter Sound. By leveraging the `flutter_sound` package and the `soundtouch` library, we were able to change the pitch of an audio signal in Flutter applications. This opens up exciting possibilities for creative audio manipulation in various domains.
