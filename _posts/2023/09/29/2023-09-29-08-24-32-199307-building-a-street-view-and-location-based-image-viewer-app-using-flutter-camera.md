Flutter is a popular cross-platform framework developed by Google for building mobile applications. In this tutorial, we will explore how to leverage the Flutter camera package to create a street view and location-based image viewer app. This app will allow users to view and capture images using the device's camera, overlay location data, and provide an immersive street view experience.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- Flutter SDK
- Flutter camera package

## Setting Up the Project

1. Create a new Flutter project using the following command:

```bash
flutter create streetview_image_viewer_app
```

2. Add the camera package dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  camera: ^0.10.0
```

3. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the camera package.

## Designing the User Interface

In this app, we will have two main screens: a street view screen and a location-based image viewer screen.

1. Create a new file `street_view_screen.dart` to define the street view screen.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class StreetViewScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Street View'),
      ),
      body: // Your street view widget code here,
    );
  }
}
```

2. Create another file `image_viewer_screen.dart` for the location-based image viewer screen.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class ImageViewerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Image Viewer'),
      ),
      body: // Your image viewer widget code here,
    );
  }
}
```

## Capturing and Displaying Images

To capture images, we will use the Flutter camera package. Let's add camera functionality to our street view screen.

1. Import the necessary packages in `street_view_screen.dart`.

```dart
import 'package:camera/camera.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

2. Initialize the camera on screen initialization.

```dart
CameraController _cameraController;
List<CameraDescription> _cameras;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _initCamera();
}

Future<void> _initCamera() async {
  _cameras = await availableCameras();
  _cameraController = CameraController(_cameras[0], ResolutionPreset.high);
  await _cameraController.initialize();
  if (!mounted) return;
  setState(() {});
}

@override
void dispose() {
  _cameraController.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```

3. Display the camera preview on the street view screen.

```dart
CameraPreview(_cameraController),
```

4. Add capture and save functionality.

```dart
Future<void> _captureAndSaveImage() async {
  try {
    final image = await _cameraController.takePicture();
    // Save the image to a location-based source (e.g., Firebase Storage)
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle error
  }
}

FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: _captureAndSaveImage,
  child: Icon(Icons.camera),
),
```

## Implementation of Image Viewer

To implement the location-based image viewer screen, we will utilize various Flutter widgets to display images based on their location.

1. Fetch the location-based images from a data source (e.g., database).

2. Create a widget to display the images on the image viewer screen.

```dart
GridView.builder(
  gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
    crossAxisCount: 2,
    crossAxisSpacing: 10.0,
    mainAxisSpacing: 10.0,
  ),
  itemCount: images.length,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return Image.network(images[index].url);
  },
)
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to build a street view and location-based image viewer app using the Flutter camera package. We covered capturing and saving images, displaying street view, and implementing a location-based image viewer screen. Now it's time to take your app to the next level by adding additional features and enhancing the user experience.
