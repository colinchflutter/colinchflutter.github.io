In today's digital world, capturing and sharing photos has become an integral part of our lives. With the advancement in smartphone technology, **image quality** has improved significantly. However, there are still instances where the quality of the captured photos can be enhanced to make them visually more appealing. In this blog post, we will explore how to build an AI-powered image enhancement app using Flutter camera.

## The Flutter Framework and Camera Plugin

Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit developed by Google, allowing developers to build beautiful cross-platform applications. The **camera plugin** provides access to the device's camera to capture images or stream live video.

## Integrating AI Image Enhancement

To enhance the captured images, we can leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence. There are several pre-trained models available that can process images and improve their overall quality. One popular AI framework is **TensorFlow**. We can use TensorFlowLite to integrate AI image enhancement into our Flutter app.

## Setting Up the Flutter Camera Plugin

To get started, we need to add the camera plugin dependency in our `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  camera: ^0.8.1
```

After adding the dependency, we need to import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:camera/camera.dart';
```

## Capturing Images and Displaying Preview

Next, we need to initialize the camera and display the preview. We can achieve this by following these steps:

1. Get the list of available cameras using `availableCameras()` method.
2. Initialize the camera using the first camera from the list.
3. Create a `CameraController` and initialize it with the selected camera.
4. Set the preview aspect ratio and start the preview.

```dart
List<CameraDescription> cameras;
CameraController _controller;

Future<void> _initializeCamera() async {
  cameras = await availableCameras();
  _controller = CameraController(cameras[0], ResolutionPreset.high);
  await _controller.initialize();
  if (!mounted) return;
  setState(() {});
}

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _initializeCamera();
}

@override
void dispose() {
  _controller.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}

...

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  if (!_controller.value.isInitialized) {
    return Container();
  }
  return AspectRatio(
    aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
    child: CameraPreview(_controller),
  );
}
```

## Implementing AI Image Enhancement

To integrate AI image enhancement, we need to process the captured image using TensorFlowLite. We can use the `tflite_flutter` package to simplify the integration process. Here's how we can do it:

1. Load the pre-trained model using `Tflite.loadModel()` method.
2. Pre-process the captured image by resizing and normalizing it.
3. Pass the pre-processed image to the loaded model using `Tflite.runModelOnFrame()` method.
4. Get the enhanced image from the result and display it.

```dart
import 'package:tflite_flutter/tflite_flutter.dart';
import 'package:image/image.dart' as img;

...

Uint8List enhanceImage(CameraImage cameraImage) {
  img.Image image = _convertCameraImage(cameraImage);
  img.Image enhancedImage = AIModel.enhance(image);
  return _convertImageToBytes(enhancedImage);
}

img.Image _convertCameraImage(CameraImage cameraImage) {
  ...
}

Uint8List _convertImageToBytes(img.Image image) {
  ...
}

@override
void dispose() {
  Tflite.close();
  _controller.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}

@override
void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
  if (state == AppLifecycleState.resumed) {
    _initializeCamera();
  }
  ...
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to build an AI-powered image enhancement app using Flutter camera. We learned how to integrate the camera plugin to capture images and display the preview. Additionally, we integrated TensorFlowLite to enhance the captured images using pre-trained AI models. With this knowledge, you can now create your own image enhancement app and take your photography to the next level!
