Flutter Sound is a powerful audio library for Flutter applications that allows you to record, playback, and manipulate audio data. In this blog post, we will explore how to perform harmonic analysis and synthesis using Flutter Sound.

## What is Harmonic Analysis?

Harmonic analysis is the process of decomposing a complex waveform into its individual harmonic components. It helps us understand the frequency content of an audio signal, which is crucial for various audio processing tasks such as equalization, pitch correction, and synthesis.

## Performing Harmonic Analysis with Flutter Sound

To perform harmonic analysis with Flutter Sound, we can use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The FFT algorithm allows us to convert a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation.

First, let's install the `flutter_sound` package in your Flutter project. Open your project's `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_sound: ^3.0.0
```

Next, import the necessary packages in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';
```

To perform harmonic analysis, we need to record an audio sample using Flutter Sound. Here is an example of recording audio using Flutter Sound:

```dart
FlutterSoundRecorder _recorder = FlutterSoundRecorder();

void recordAudio() async {
  await _recorder.openAudioSession();
  await _recorder.startRecorder(toFile: 'path_to_save_file.wav');
}

void stopRecording() async {
  await _recorder.stopRecorder();
  await _recorder.closeAudioSession();
}
```

Once we have recorded an audio sample, we can perform the FFT to obtain the frequency-domain representation of the signal. Here is an example of performing FFT using Flutter Sound:

```dart
FlutterSoundPlayer _player = FlutterSoundPlayer();

void analyzeAudio() async {
  List<int> audioData = await File('path_to_audio_file.wav').readAsBytes();
  List<double> audioSamples = Float32List.fromList(audioData).toList();

  final complexData = _player.getLatestWaveData();
  final fft = complexData.fft();
  // Process the FFT data and extract harmonic components
}
```

## Synthesizing Audio with Flutter Sound

Once we have analyzed the audio and extracted the harmonic components, we can synthesize new audio by manipulating the harmonic components. Flutter Sound allows us to generate audio samples programmatically using the `AudioTrack` class. Here is an example of synthesizing audio using Flutter Sound:

```dart
FlutterSoundPlayer _player = FlutterSoundPlayer();

void synthesizeAudio() {
  final harmonicComponents = // Retrieve harmonic components from analysis

  final audioData = List<double>.generate(samplesCount, (index) {
    double sampleValue = 0;
    for (var harmonic in harmonicComponents) {
      sampleValue += harmonic.amplitude * sin(harmonic.frequency * index);
    }
    return sampleValue;
  });

  final track = AudioTrack();
  track.feedFromStream(audioData);
  track.startPlayer();
}
```

In the above code, the `synthesizeAudio` function generates audio samples by summing the sinusoidal components of the harmonic components. The resulting audio samples are then fed to an `AudioTrack` and played using Flutter Sound.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to perform audio harmonic analysis and synthesis using Flutter Sound. By leveraging the power of Flutter Sound and the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm, we can analyze the frequency content of an audio signal, extract harmonic components, and synthesize new audio based on these components. This opens up a world of possibilities for audio processing and synthesis in Flutter applications. Have fun experimenting with audio analysis and synthesis in your Flutter projects!
