Flutter Sound is a powerful audio plugin for Flutter that allows developers to record, play, and process audio. One of the useful features it offers is audio time-stretching, which allows you to change the playback speed of audio without affecting its pitch.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio time-stretching using the phase vocoder algorithm in Flutter Sound.

## What is Time-Stretching?

Time-stretching is an audio processing technique that alters the playback speed of an audio signal while preserving its pitch. This is useful in various applications such as music production, audio editing, and speech recognition.

## Phase Vocoder Algorithm

The phase vocoder is a popular algorithm used for time-stretching and pitch-shifting audio signals. It operates on the frequency domain and can stretch or compress the signal in time without affecting the pitch.

Here's an example code snippet showing how to implement audio time-stretching using the phase vocoder algorithm in Flutter Sound:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';
import 'dart:typed_data';
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';
import 'package:flutter_sound_platform_interface/flutter_sound_recorder_platform_interface.dart';

Future<void> timeStretchAudio(String inputFilePath, String outputFilePath, double stretchFactor) async {
  // Open input file
  final inputAudio = await FlutterSound().openAudioSession();
  await inputAudio.startPlayer(fromURI: inputFilePath);

  // Create output file
  final outputAudio = await FlutterSoundRecorder().openAudioSession();
  await outputAudio.startRecorder(toFile: outputFilePath, 
    codec: Codec.aacADTS,
    sampleRate: inputAudio.sampleRate);

  // Set time-stretch factor
  await FlutterSound().setPlaySpeed(livePlayback: true, playSpeed: stretchFactor);

  // Process audio in chunks
  final bufferSize = 8192;
  final buffer = Uint8List(bufferSize);
  while (inputAudio.isRecording) {
    final readResult = await inputAudio.read(buffer);
    if (readResult != 0) {
      await outputAudio.write(buffer);
    } else {
      break;
    }
  }

  // Cleanup
  await inputAudio.stopPlayer();
  await inputAudio.closeAudioSession();
  await outputAudio.stopRecorder();
  await outputAudio.closeAudioSession();
}
```

## Usage

To use the `timeStretchAudio` function, you need to pass the input file path, output file path, and the desired time-stretch factor. Make sure to provide valid audio file paths and a stretch factor greater than zero.

```dart
final inputFile = 'path/to/input/audio.wav';
final outputFile = 'path/to/output/audio.wav';
final stretchFactor = 1.5; // Increase speed by 50%

await timeStretchAudio(inputFile, outputFile, stretchFactor);
```

In the example above, the function reads audio data from the input file, time-stretches it using the phase vocoder algorithm with the specified stretch factor, and writes the resulting audio to the output file.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement audio time-stretching using the phase vocoder algorithm in Flutter Sound. We learned about time-stretching, its applications, and the phase vocoder algorithm. With the provided code sample, you can now incorporate time-stretching capabilities into your Flutter applications. Happy coding!
