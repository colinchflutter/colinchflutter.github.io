In this tech blog post, we will explore how to implement audio beat matching and BPM (beats per minute) detection using the Flutter Sound package. Beat matching is a technique widely used in music production and DJ-ing to synchronize the tempo of different tracks. BPM detection, on the other hand, is the process of determining the tempo of an audio track. By combining these two concepts, we can create powerful applications that can automatically sync beats or analyze the tempo of audio files.

## Getting Started with Flutter Sound

First, let's start by including the Flutter Sound package in our Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_sound: ^X.X.X # Replace with the latest version
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package from Pub.dev.

## Beat Matching

To implement beat matching, we need to analyze the beats of two audio tracks and find the most similar beats to align them. Flutter Sound provides a feature called "waveform streaming" that allows us to process the audio waveform in real-time.

First, we need to initialize the audio player and open the audio files:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';

final player = FlutterSoundPlayer();

await player.openAudioSession();

await player.startPlayer(
  fromURI: 'path/to/audio1.mp3',
);

await player.startPlayer(
  fromURI: 'path/to/audio2.mp3',
);
```

Next, we can use the `getWaveFormStream` method to get a stream of audio waveform data:

```dart
final waveformStream = await player.getWaveFormStream();

waveformStream.listen((waveformData) {
  // Process the waveform data
});
```

With the waveform data, we can extract the beats using beat detection algorithms such as the "onset detection" algorithm. For simplicity, let's say we already have a list of beats for both audio tracks.

Now, we need to calculate the offset between the beats of the two audio tracks and adjust the playback speed to match them:

```dart
// Assume we have two arrays of beats: audio1Beats and audio2Beats

final audio1BeatTime = calculateAverageBeatTime(audio1Beats);
final audio2BeatTime = calculateAverageBeatTime(audio2Beats);

final offset = audio2BeatTime - audio1BeatTime;

player.setPlaybackRate(1.0 - (offset / audio1BeatTime));
```

By adjusting the playback rate, we can align the beats of the two audio tracks. Experiment with different values to achieve the best synchronization.

## BPM Detection

To implement BPM detection, we need to analyze the audio waveform and calculate the beats per minute. Flutter Sound provides a built-in BPM detection method that we can utilize.

First, let's start by recording audio:

```dart
final recorder = FlutterSoundRecorder();

await recorder.openAudioSession();

await recorder.startRecorder(
  toFile: 'path/to/recording.wav',
);
```

Next, we can use the `getBpm` method to calculate the BPM of the recorded audio:

```dart
final bpm = await recorder.getBpm(
  pathToAudioFile: 'path/to/recording.wav',
);

print('BPM: $bpm');
```

The `getBpm` method returns the calculated BPM. You can use this value to display the tempo of the audio track or perform further analysis.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to implement audio beat matching and BPM detection using the Flutter Sound package. Beat matching allows us to synchronize the beats of multiple audio tracks, while BPM detection helps us analyze the tempo of audio files. By combining these techniques, we can build powerful applications for music production, DJ-ing, or any other audio-related tasks.
