Flutter is a flexible and versatile framework for building beautiful user interfaces across different platforms. With a rich library of plugins and packages, Flutter allows developers to enhance their apps with various functionalities. In this blog post, we'll explore how to add image style transfer and artistic filters to a Flutter app.

## What is Image Style Transfer?

Image style transfer is a technique that allows you to apply the style of one image onto another image. It is based on deep learning algorithms that analyze the content and style of the input images and generate a new image that combines the content of one image and the style of another.

## Adding Image Style Transfer to a Flutter app

To add image style transfer to a Flutter app, we can use the `tflite` plugin, which provides a Flutter interface for TensorFlow Lite. TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight version of TensorFlow, optimized for mobile and embedded devices.

First, we need to add the `tflite` plugin to our `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  tflite: ^1.0.0
```

Next, we need to download the pre-trained style transfer model in TensorFlow Lite format. You can find various style transfer models online or create your own using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Once you have the model, place it in the assets folder of your Flutter project.

In your Dart code, load the model using the `Tflite.loadModel` method:

```dart
import 'package:tflite/tflite.dart';

loadModel() async {
  await Tflite.loadModel(
    model: 'assets/style_transfer_model.tflite',
  );
}
```

Now, we can use the loaded model to apply the style transfer to an input image. First, read the input image using the `ImagePicker` plugin:

```dart
import 'package:image_picker/image_picker.dart';

final picker = ImagePicker();

File imageFile;

pickImage() async {
  final pickedFile = await picker.getImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
  if (pickedFile != null) {
    imageFile = File(pickedFile.path);
    applyStyleTransfer();
  }
}
```

Then, preprocess the input image and perform the style transfer using the `Tflite.runModelOnImage` method:

```dart
applyStyleTransfer() async {
  var inputImage = Image.file(imageFile);

  var outputImage = await Tflite.runModelOnImage(
    path: inputImage.path,
  );

  // Display the output image
}
```

Finally, display the output image in your Flutter app. You can use the `Image` widget to show the output image:

```dart
Image.memory(
  outputImage,
  fit: BoxFit.contain,
)
```

## Adding Artistic Filters to a Flutter app

Apart from image style transfer, you can also add artistic filters to your Flutter app by applying various image processing techniques. Flutter provides the `image` package, which offers a wide range of image manipulation features.

To add artistic filters, first add the `image` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  image: ^2.1.19
```

Import the `dart:io` and `package:image/image.dart` packages in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:image/image.dart' as img;
```

Then, read the input image using the `ImagePicker` plugin as mentioned in the previous section. Load and apply the desired filter to the input image using the `image` package functions:

```dart
import 'package:image/image.dart' as img;

applyFilter() async {
  var inputImageFile = File(imageFile.path);
  var image = img.decodeImage(inputImageFile.readAsBytesSync());

  // Apply the filter to the image
  var filteredImage = img.sobel(image);

  // Display the filtered image
}
```

Finally, display the filtered image in your Flutter app using the `Image.memory` widget as mentioned in the previous section.

## Conclusion

By adding image style transfer and artistic filters to your Flutter app, you can enhance the visual appeal and creativity of your user interface. With the help of plugins like `tflite` and packages like `image`, incorporating these features becomes straightforward and accessible. Experiment with different styles and filters to create visually stunning experiences for your users!
