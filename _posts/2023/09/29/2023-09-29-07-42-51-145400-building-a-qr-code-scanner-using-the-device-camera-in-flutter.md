QR codes are an efficient and convenient way to store and share information. In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a QR code scanner using the device camera in Flutter. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine
- Text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice

## Getting Started

To begin, create a new Flutter project and navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt. Then, open the project in your text editor or IDE.

## Installing Dependencies

To scan QR codes, we will use the `barcode_scan` package. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  barcode_scan: ^5.0.0
```

Save the file and run `flutter pub get` in your terminal or IDE terminal to download and install the package.

## Building the QR Code Scanner

First, import the necessary packages in the Dart file where you want to create the QR code scanner:

```dart
import 'package:barcode_scan/barcode_scan.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

Next, create a `FlatButton` widget that will trigger the scanning process when pressed:

```dart
FlatButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    String qrCodeResult = await BarcodeScanner.scan();
    setState(() {
      // Handle the scanned qrCodeResult
    });
  },
  child: Text("Scan QR Code"),
)
```

Inside the `onPressed` method, we are using the `BarcodeScanner.scan()` method from the `barcode_scan` package to launch the scanning process. The scanned result will be stored in the `qrCodeResult` variable.

Remember to use the `await` keyword when calling `BarcodeScanner.scan()` as it returns a `Future<String>`.

Now, you can handle the scanned result according to your requirements. For example, you can display it in a `Text` widget:

```dart
String qrCodeResult = await BarcodeScanner.scan();
setState(() {
  _scannedResult = qrCodeResult;
});
```

In the above example, `_scannedResult` is a variable that stores the scanned result. You can use this variable to display the scanned QR code in a `Text` widget or further process it as needed.

## Running the App

To run the app, connect your device/emulator and ensure it is recognized by running `flutter devices` in your terminal or IDE terminal.

Then, use `flutter run` to launch the app on your device/emulator. You should see the "Scan QR Code" button on the screen. Pressing this button will launch the camera and allow you to scan QR codes.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to build a QR code scanner using the device camera in Flutter. QR code scanning can be a useful tool in various mobile applications, from scanning tickets to processing payments.

Remember to handle error cases and add appropriate error handling for a real-world application. Feel free to explore more features and customization options provided by the `barcode_scan` package to enhance your QR code scanning capability.
