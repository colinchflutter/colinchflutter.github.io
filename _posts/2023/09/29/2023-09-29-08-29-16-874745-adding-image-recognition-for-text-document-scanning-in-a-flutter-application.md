In this tutorial, we will explore how to add image recognition capabilities to a Flutter application for scanning text documents. By using image recognition, we can extract the text from images and make it searchable or editable within our application. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:

1. Flutter SDK installed on your machine
2. Flutter project created

## Installing Dependencies

To add image recognition capabilities to our Flutter application, we need to install the `firebase_ml_vision` package. This package provides a set of APIs for performing image analysis and recognition tasks. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Then, run the following command to install the package:

```dart
flutter pub add firebase_ml_vision
```

## Configuring Firebase

We need to configure Firebase in our Flutter application to use the ML Vision APIs. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project or select an existing one.
2. Enable ML Kit for your Firebase project by going to **Firebase Console > ML Kit > Get Started**.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enable ML Kit for your project.

## Implementing Image Recognition

Now that we have installed the dependencies and configured Firebase, let's implement image recognition for text document scanning in our Flutter application. Open the file where you want to add the image recognition functionality.

First, import the required packages:

```dart
import 'package:firebase_ml_vision/firebase_ml_vision.dart';
import 'package:image_picker/image_picker.dart';
```

Next, create a method for selecting an image from the device's gallery or camera:

```dart
Future<File> _pickImage(ImageSource source) async {
  var image = await ImagePicker().getImage(source: source);
  return File(image.path);
}
```

To recognize text from the selected image, create a method like this:

```dart
Future<String> _recognizeText(File image) async {
  final FirebaseVisionImage visionImage = FirebaseVisionImage.fromFile(image);
  final TextRecognizer textRecognizer = FirebaseVision.instance.textRecognizer();
  final VisionText visionText = await textRecognizer.processImage(visionImage);
  String recognizedText = visionText.text;
  return recognizedText;
}
```

Now, you can call these methods to select an image and recognize text:

```dart
File selectedImage = await _pickImage(ImageSource.gallery);
String recognizedText = await _recognizeText(selectedImage);
print(recognizedText);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully added image recognition for text document scanning in your Flutter application using the `firebase_ml_vision` package. You can now extract text from images and utilize it within your app. Happy coding!
