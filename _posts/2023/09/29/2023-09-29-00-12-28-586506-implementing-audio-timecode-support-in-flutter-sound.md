Flutter Sound is a powerful audio recording and playback package for the Flutter framework. It provides developers with a comprehensive set of functionalities for working with audio files. However, one feature that is not included out of the box is audio timecode support. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement audio timecode support in Flutter Sound.

## What is audio timecode?

Audio timecode is a method of synchronizing audio and video recordings. It is a timestamp that indicates the position of audio data within a recording. Having accurate timecode is crucial when working with professional audio recordings, especially in scenarios where synchronization with video is required.

## The challenge

Flutter Sound provides APIs for recording and playing audio files, but it does not have built-in support for timecode. Therefore, the challenge is to find a way to incorporate timecode functionality into Flutter Sound.

## The solution

To implement audio timecode support in Flutter Sound, we can leverage the `Dart` programming language's capabilities and existing timecode libraries. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

1. **Choose a timecode library**: There are several timecode libraries available in `Dart` that we can use. For example, the `timecode` library provides utilities for working with SMPTE timecode.

   ```dart
   dependencies:
     timecode: ^1.0.0
   ```

2. **Integrate the timecode library**: Import the timecode library in your Flutter Sound project.

   ```dart
   import 'package:timecode/timecode.dart';
   ```

3. **Implement timecode calculations**: Use the timecode library to perform timecode calculations, such as converting timecode to frames, frames to timecode, and adding or subtracting frames from timecode.

   ```dart
   // Convert timecode to frames
   String timecode = '00:01:00:00';
   int frames = Timecode.fromString(timecode).frames;

   // Convert frames to timecode
   int frames = 1800;
   String timecode = Timecode.fromFrames(frames).toString();

   // Add frames to timecode
   String timecode = '00:01:00:00';
   int framesToAdd = 900;
   String newTimecode = (Timecode.fromString(timecode) + framesToAdd).toString();
   ```

4. **Integrate timecode functionality**: Identify the appropriate places within the Flutter Sound codebase where timecode calculations should occur. For example, when recording audio, store the starting timecode. When playing audio, calculate the current timecode based on the playback position.

5. **Display timecode**: Update your app's UI to display the current timecode during playback.

## Conclusion

By leveraging existing timecode libraries in `Dart` and integrating them into the Flutter Sound codebase, you can add audio timecode support to your Flutter applications. This enables better synchronization between audio and video recordings, especially in professional audio production scenarios. Take advantage of the flexibility and capabilities of Flutter Sound along with timecode libraries to create robust multimedia applications.
