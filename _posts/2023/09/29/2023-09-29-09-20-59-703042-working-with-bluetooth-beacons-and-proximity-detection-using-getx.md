Bluetooth beacons are small, wireless devices that broadcast signals to nearby devices. They are commonly used for proximity detection, allowing apps to detect when a user is near a specific location or object. In this blog post, we will explore how to work with Bluetooth beacons and implement proximity detection using the GetX package in Flutter.

## What are Bluetooth Beacons?

Bluetooth beacons are small devices that transmit signals using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. They typically use a coin-cell battery for power and can be placed in various physical locations. When a Bluetooth-enabled device comes within range of a beacon, it can receive the beacon's signal and perform certain actions based on the proximity.

## Using the GetX Package in Flutter

GetX is a lightweight yet powerful package for managing state, navigation, and dependencies in Flutter apps. It provides an easy way to handle complex tasks such as working with Bluetooth beacons.

To get started, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  get: ^4.1.4
```

Next, import the necessary packages into your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:get/get.dart';
import 'package:get/get_state_manager.dart';
import 'package:get/get_navigation/src/extension_navigation.dart';
```

## Scanning for Beacon Signals

To detect nearby Bluetooth beacons, we need to use the FlutterBlue package. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_blue: ^0.7.3
```

Then, import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_blue/flutter_blue.dart';
```

Next, create an instance of `FlutterBlue` and start scanning for nearby devices:

```dart
final flutterBlue = FlutterBlue.instance;

flutterBlue.startScan();
```

You can listen for Bluetooth events using the GetX `Worker`:

```dart
class BeaconController extends GetxController {
  final flutterBlue = FlutterBlue.instance.obs;

  @override
  void onInit() {
    ever(flutterBlue, (BluetoothState state) {
      if (state == BluetoothState.on) {
        flutterBlue.value.startScan();
      }
    });
    super.onInit();
  }
}
```

## Handling Proximity Detection

Once you detect a beacon, you can determine its proximity by calculating the signal strength. The closer the beacon, the stronger the signal. In FlutterBlue, you can access the signal strength through the `ScanResult` object.

Here's an example of how to handle proximity detection using GetX:

```dart
flutterBlue.scanResults.listen((List<ScanResult> results) {
  for (ScanResult result in results) {
    final device = result.device;
    final rssi = result.rssi;

    final proximity = calculateProximity(rssi); // Function to calculate proximity based on RSSI value

    if (proximity == Proximity.near) {
      // Perform actions when beacon is near
    } else if (proximity == Proximity.far) {
      // Perform actions when beacon is far
    }
  }
});
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to work with Bluetooth beacons and implement proximity detection using the GetX package in Flutter. We discovered how to scan for beacon signals, handle proximity detection, and perform actions based on the detected proximity.

Using Bluetooth beacons and proximity detection can enhance the user experience of your app, opening up possibilities for location-based functionalities. With the power of GetX, handling these complex tasks becomes simplified, allowing you to focus on building great apps.
