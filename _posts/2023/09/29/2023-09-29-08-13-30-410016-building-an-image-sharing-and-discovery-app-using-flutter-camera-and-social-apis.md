In this tutorial, we will explore how to build an image sharing and discovery app using Flutter. We will leverage the device's camera functionality to capture and upload images. Additionally, we will integrate social APIs to enable users to share, like, and comment on the uploaded images.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, ensure that you have the following:

- Flutter SDK installed and set up on your machine
- Android Studio or any other code editor of your choice
- Basic knowledge of Flutter and Dart programming language

## Setting up the Project

1. Create a new Flutter project using the Flutter command line tool or the IDE's built-in project creation wizard.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.

## Integrating the Camera

1. Add the `camera` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  camera: ^0.9.4+5
```

2. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the packages.

3. Inside your main `lib` folder, create a new file called `camera_screen.dart`.

4. Import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:camera/camera.dart';
```

5. Create a stateful widget called `CameraScreen`:

```dart
class CameraScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CameraScreenState createState() => _CameraScreenState();
}

class _CameraScreenState extends State<CameraScreen> {
  CameraController _controller;
  List<CameraDescription> _cameras;
  Future<void> _initializeControllerFuture;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initializeCamera();
  }

  Future<void> _initializeCamera() async {
    _cameras = await availableCameras();
    _controller = CameraController(
      _cameras[0],
      ResolutionPreset.medium,
    );
    await _controller.initialize();
    if (!mounted) return;
    setState(() {});
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller?.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    if (!_controller.value.isInitialized) {
      return Container();
    }
    return Scaffold(
      body: CameraPreview(_controller),
    );
  }
}
```

6. In your app's main file (`main.dart`), replace the default `MyApp` class with the following code:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Image Sharing App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CameraScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

Now, when you run the app, it should open the camera screen.

## Integrating Social APIs

To enable image sharing, liking, and commenting functionalities, we will integrate social APIs such as Firebase or a custom backend with a database.

1. Set up Firebase for your project by following the official documentation.

2. Implement authentication using Firebase Auth to register and login users.

3. Set up Firebase Cloud Firestore to store image metadata, user details, likes, and comments.

4. Implement upload functionality to store captured images in Firebase Storage and save their metadata in Firestore.

5. Create screens for image sharing, liking, and commenting using Flutter's UI components.

6. Integrate Firebase Firestore to retrieve and display images, likes, comments, and update them in real-time.

7. Implement functionality for users to like and comment on images, and update the respective Firestore documents accordingly.

8. Implement image sharing functionality using Flutter's share plugin to enable users to share images via other social media platforms.

## Conclusion

With Flutter's camera and social API integrations, you can now build an image sharing and discovery app with features such as image capture, storage, social interactions, and more. Remember to optimize the app's performance and user experience for a successful app launch.
