Augmented reality (AR) has become a popular technology that blends the real world with virtual elements, enhancing user experiences across various industries. With the help of frameworks like GetX, integrating AR into your applications has become easier than ever. In this blog post, we will explore how to work with AR and 3D models using GetX.

## Why GetX?

GetX is a powerful state management library for Flutter that simplifies development and improves performance. It provides a robust set of features, including reactive state management, dependency injection, and route management. Leveraging GetX in the context of augmented reality can lead to a seamless and efficient development experience.

## Setting up the Project

To get started, create a new Flutter project and add the GetX dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  get: ^4.3.0
  arkit_plugin: ^0.8.0
```

Next, run `flutter pub get` to download the dependencies.

## Adding AR Functionality

In this example, we'll focus on integrating ARKit into our project. However, you can adapt the code to use other AR frameworks as needed.

1. Begin by creating a new file called `ar_page.dart`, which will contain the AR functionality.

2. Import the necessary packages at the top of the file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:get/get.dart';
import 'package:arkit_plugin/arkit_plugin.dart';
```

3. Create a widget that extends `GetXController`, which will handle the AR state and actions:

```dart
class ARPageController extends GetxController {
  ARKitController? arController;
  bool isTracking = false;
  bool isDetecting = false;

  @override
  void onInit() {
    super.onInit();
    ARKitPlugin().start().then((value) {
      arController = value;
    });
  }

  @override
  void onClose() {
    arController?.dispose();
    super.onClose();
  }
}
```

4. Create the actual AR page widget:

```dart
class ARPage extends StatelessWidget {
  final ARPageController controller = Get.put(ARPageController());

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('AR Page'),
      ),
      body: ARKitSceneView(
        showFeaturePoints: controller.isDetecting,
        trackingConfiguration: ARKitConfiguration.world,
        onARKitViewCreated: controller.arController?.onARKitViewCreated,
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Trigger AR actions
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

5. Finally, in your main application file, navigate to the AR page:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(GetMaterialApp(
    home: ARPage(),
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

By leveraging the power of GetX, integrating augmented reality and 3D models into your Flutter applications becomes an efficient and straightforward process. GetX simplifies state management and enables developers to focus on delivering immersive experiences to users.
