With the increasing popularity of smart speakers and smart home systems, multi-room audio playback has become a desirable feature. Flutter Sound, a versatile audio plugin for Flutter, makes it possible to implement this functionality in your Flutter app. In this blog post, we will guide you through the process of setting up multi-room audio playback using Flutter Sound.

## What is Flutter Sound?

**Flutter Sound** is a feature-rich audio plugin for Flutter that provides a wide range of audio playback and recording capabilities. It supports various audio file formats, streaming, audio effects, and device-specific features. Flutter Sound is a powerful tool for building audio-centric applications.

## Setting up the project

To get started with multi-room audio playback using Flutter Sound, you'll need to set up a Flutter project and add the Flutter Sound dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_sound: ^10.1.8
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package and its dependencies.

## Creating the audio player service

Next, you will need to create a service that handles the audio playback across multiple rooms. This service will handle the initialization, playback control, and synchronization of audio streams.

Let's create a new Dart file called `audio_player_service.dart` and define our audio player service class.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sound/flutter_sound.dart';

class AudioPlayerService {
  FlutterSoundPlayer? _audioPlayer;

  void init() {
    _audioPlayer = FlutterSoundPlayer();
    // Additional initialization code...
  }

  void play(String url) {
    // Play the audio stream from the provided URL
    _audioPlayer?.openAudioSession().then((value) {
      _audioPlayer?.startPlayer(url);
    });
  }

  void stop() {
    // Stop the audio playback
    _audioPlayer?.stopPlayer();
    _audioPlayer?.closeAudioSession();
  }
}
```

In this code snippet, we import the `flutter_sound` library and define the `AudioPlayerService` class. The service initializes the `FlutterSoundPlayer` instance and provides methods to control the playback.

## Integrating multi-room playback

To enable multi-room playback, you'll need to create multiple instances of the `AudioPlayerService` class, each representing a different audio source or room.

In your Flutter app, you can create as many instances of `AudioPlayerService` as needed and control them accordingly. For example, you can have a screen with buttons representing different rooms, and each button triggers the playback of the corresponding audio source.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'audio_player_service.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final AudioPlayerService audioPlayerService1 = AudioPlayerService();
  final AudioPlayerService audioPlayerService2 = AudioPlayerService();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Multi-room Audio Playback',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Multi-room Audio Playback'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  audioPlayerService1.play('https://room1-audio.mp3');
                },
                child: const Text('Play in Room 1'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  audioPlayerService2.play('https://room2-audio.mp3');
                },
                child: const Text('Play in Room 2'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create two instances of `AudioPlayerService` representing two different rooms. We then use `ElevatedButton` widgets to trigger the playback of each audio source. When a button is pressed, the corresponding `AudioPlayerService` instance plays the respective audio stream.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explained how to implement multi-room audio playback using Flutter Sound. By creating an audio player service and controlling multiple instances, you can achieve synchronized playback across different rooms or audio sources in your Flutter app. Flutter Sound provides a flexible and powerful audio plugin for building feature-rich audio applications. Give it a try and explore the possibilities of multi-room audio playback!
