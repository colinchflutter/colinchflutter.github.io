Flutter provides a powerful framework for building cross-platform mobile applications, including features for capturing images using the device's camera. Once the images are captured, it is often necessary to preview and display them within the app. In this blog post, we will explore how to preview and display captured images in a Flutter app.

## Importing the required packages

To work with images in Flutter, we need to import the `image_picker` and `flutter_cache_manager` packages. The `image_picker` package allows us to capture images from the device's camera, while the `flutter_cache_manager` package enables us to efficiently cache and display the images.

```dart
import 'package:image_picker/image_picker.dart';
import 'package:flutter_cache_manager/flutter_cache_manager.dart';
```

## Previewing the captured image

To preview a captured image, we can use the `Image.file` widget provided by Flutter. This widget takes in a file path and displays the image on the screen. Here's an example of how to preview a captured image:

```dart
File _image;

void _previewImage(File image) {
  setState(() {
    _image = image;
  });
}

Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('Image Preview'),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: _image == null
          ? Text('No image selected')
          : Image.file(_image),
    ),
    floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
      onPressed: () async {
        File image = await ImagePicker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.camera);
        _previewImage(image);
      },
      child: Icon(Icons.camera),
    ),
  );
}
```

In the example code above, we use the `ImagePicker.pickImage` method from the `image_picker` package to capture an image from the device's camera. The `_previewImage` method is called to update the state with the captured image, and the `Image.file` widget is used to display the image on the screen.

## Caching and displaying images efficiently

When dealing with captured images, it is important to consider performance and memory usage. The `flutter_cache_manager` package provides a convenient solution for caching and displaying images in Flutter. Here's an example of how to use it:

```dart
void _previewImage(File image) {
  setState(() {
    _image = image;
    DefaultCacheManager().putFile(image.path, image.readAsBytesSync());
  });
}

Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    // ...
    body: Center(
      child: _image == null
          ? Text('No image selected')
          : CachedNetworkImage(
              imageUrl: _image.path,
              placeholder: (context, url) => CircularProgressIndicator(),
              errorWidget: (context, url, error) => Icon(Icons.error),
            ),
    ),
    // ...
  );
}
```

In the updated code, we use the `DefaultCacheManager().putFile` method to cache the captured image before displaying it. The `CachedNetworkImage` widget is used to display the image, with a placeholder and error widget specified for a better user experience.

## Conclusion

Previewing and displaying captured images is a common requirement in Flutter mobile applications. By using the `image_picker` and `flutter_cache_manager` packages, we can easily accomplish this task in an efficient way. Feel free to explore more options and customize the code to match your specific app requirements.
