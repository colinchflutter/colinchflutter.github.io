Are you looking to create a unique and visually appealing task manager UI? Look no further! In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a custom task manager UI using Flutter's Custom Painter.

## What is Flutter Custom Painter?

Flutter Custom Painter is a powerful feature that allows you to create custom graphics and animations within a Flutter application. It provides a canvas on which you can draw and manipulate shapes, gradients, and images.

## Getting Started

To begin, make sure you have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine. Create a new Flutter project, or open an existing one in your preferred code editor.

## Creating the Task Manager UI

### Step 1: Define the Custom Painter

Inside your Flutter project, create a new Dart file called 'task_manager_painter.dart'. This file will define our custom painter class. Start by importing the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'dart:math';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

Next, define your custom painter class:

```dart
class TaskManagerPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Insert your custom painting logic here
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) => false;
}
```

### Step 2: Implement the Task Manager UI

Now that we have our custom painter class set up, let's implement the task manager UI in our main widget. Open 'main.dart' file and modify the `build` method of your main widget as follows:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text("Task Manager"),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: CustomPaint(
        painter: TaskManagerPainter(),
        child: Container(
          constraints: BoxConstraints.expand(),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Custom Painting Logic

Inside the `paint` method of the `TaskManagerPainter` class, we can implement our custom painting logic. Let's start by drawing the background and some basic shapes:

```dart
@override
void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  // Draw background
  canvas.drawRect(
    Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, size.width, size.height),
    Paint()..color = Colors.white,
  );

  // Draw shapes
  canvas.drawCircle(
    Offset(size.width * 0.25, size.height * 0.25),
    min(size.width, size.height) * 0.1,
    Paint()..color = Colors.blue,
  );

  canvas.drawRRect(
    RRect.fromLTRBR(
      size.width * 0.4,
      size.height * 0.35,
      size.width * 0.6,
      size.height * 0.65,
      Radius.circular(8),
    ),
    Paint()..color = Colors.green,
  );

  // Draw more shapes and text as desired

}
```

Feel free to customize the shapes, colors, and positions based on your desired task manager UI.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to build a custom task manager UI using Flutter's Custom Painter. This allows you to create unique and visually appealing interfaces for your Flutter applications. Remember to experiment with different shapes, colors, and layouts to make your UI stand out.
