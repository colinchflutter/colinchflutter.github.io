State restoration is an important feature in Flutter apps, as it allows users to seamlessly transition between app states even if the app is closed or the device is restarted. In this blog post, we will explore how to handle state restoration when using custom themes in Flutter apps.

## Why is State Restoration Important?

State restoration ensures that users can effortlessly resume their work within an app, even after interruptions or device changes. It saves the app's current state, such as user inputs, selected items, or scroll positions, and restores them when the app is reopened.

## Using Custom Themes in Flutter Apps

Custom themes allow developers to create a consistent and visually appealing UI design across the app. With custom themes, you can define your own colors, fonts, and other visual properties to match your app's branding.

However, when it comes to state restoration, custom themes can introduce some challenges. By default, Flutter uses the app's theme data to restore the app's state. But when a custom theme is applied, it may not inherit the theme data set by Flutter for state restoration.

To handle state restoration with custom themes, you need to manually restore the theme data and apply it to your app's UI.

## Steps to Handle State Restoration with Custom Themes

Here are the steps to handle state restoration with custom themes in Flutter apps:

1. Add the `flutter_localizations` and `shared_preferences` dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file if you haven't already. These packages are essential for handling state restoration and storing app state.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter_localizations:
       sdk: flutter

     shared_preferences: ^2.0.6
   ```

2. Create a helper class to manage theme restoration. This class will be responsible for saving and restoring the app's theme state.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

   class ThemeRestorationHelper {
     static Future<void> saveThemeMode(ThemeMode themeMode) async {
       SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
       prefs.setString('themeMode', themeMode.toString());
     }

     static Future<ThemeMode> getSavedTimeMode() async {
       SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
       String? themeModeString = prefs.getString('themeMode');

       if (themeModeString == ThemeMode.system.toString()) {
         return ThemeMode.system;
       } else if (themeModeString == ThemeMode.dark.toString()) {
         return ThemeMode.dark;
       } else {
         return ThemeMode.light;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. In your app's main entry point, retrieve the saved theme mode and apply it to the app's theme.

   ```dart
   Future<void> main() async {
     WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

     // Retrieve saved theme mode
     ThemeMode themeMode = await ThemeRestorationHelper.getSavedTimeMode();

     runApp(MyApp(initialThemeMode: themeMode));
   }

   class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
     final ThemeMode initialThemeMode;

     MyApp({required this.initialThemeMode});

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return MaterialApp(
         themeMode: initialThemeMode,
         theme: ThemeData.light(), // Apply your custom light theme here
         darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(), // Apply your custom dark theme here
         home: MyHomePage(),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

4. Implement the state restoration capability in your app's widgets. This will involve saving and restoring the necessary state variables.

   ```dart
   class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
   }

   class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> with RestorationMixin {
     final RestorableBool isSwitchOn = RestorableBool(false);

     @override
     String get restorationId => 'home_page';

     @override
     void restoreState(RestorationBucket? oldBucket, bool initialRestore) {
       registerForRestoration(isSwitchOn, 'switch_state');
     }

     @override
     void dispose() {
       isSwitchOn.dispose();
       super.dispose();
     }

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(
           title: Text('State Restoration'),
         ),
         body: Center(
           child: Switch(
             value: isSwitchOn.value,
             onChanged: (bool newValue) {
               setState(() {
                 isSwitchOn.value = newValue;
               });
             },
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```
