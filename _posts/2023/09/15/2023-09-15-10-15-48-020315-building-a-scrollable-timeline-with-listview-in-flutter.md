In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a scrollable timeline using the ListView widget in Flutter. A timeline is a common component in many apps that allows users to view and interact with a list of events or activities in chronological order. 

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Flutter and have Flutter SDK installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

Let's start by creating a new Flutter project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```dart
flutter create scrollable_timeline
```

This command will create a new Flutter project named "scrollable_timeline". Change directory to the project folder:

```dart
cd scrollable_timeline
```

Open the `lib/main.dart` file and replace its contents with the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Scrollable Timeline',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: TimelineScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class TimelineScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<String> events = [
    'Event 1',
    'Event 2',
    'Event 3',
    'Event 4',
    'Event 5',
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Scrollable Timeline'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: events.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(events[index]),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, we define a new Flutter application and create a `TimelineScreen` widget. Inside the `TimelineScreen` widget, we create a list of events and display them using the `ListView.builder` widget.

Run the app by executing the following command in your terminal:

```dart
flutter run
```

You should now have a basic Flutter app with a scrollable timeline implemented using the ListView widget. Feel free to customize the UI and add more functionality to suit your needs.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to build a basic scrollable timeline using the ListView widget in Flutter. ListView provides an easy and efficient way to create a scrollable list of items. You can further enhance the timeline by adding images, descriptions, and interactive features to each event.
