In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a custom movie streaming app UI using the **Flutter Custom Painter** class. Flutter Custom Painter allows developers to define custom graphics and animations by painting on a canvas.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have Flutter installed and set up on your development environment. You can find detailed instructions on how to set up Flutter in the official [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

## Steps to Build the App UI

1. **Create a new Flutter project** by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```dart
   flutter create movie_streaming_app
   ```

2. **Open the project** in your preferred code editor.

3. **Replace the content of the `lib/main.dart`** file with the following code:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

   void main() {
     runApp(MovieStreamingApp());
   }

   class MovieStreamingApp extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return MaterialApp(
         title: 'Movie Streaming App',
         theme: ThemeData(
           primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
           visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity,
         ),
         home: MovieStreamingScreen(),
       );
     }
   }

   class MovieStreamingScreen extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(
           title: Text('Movie Streaming App'),
         ),
         body: Center(
           child: CustomPaint(
             painter: MovieStreamingPainter(), // Custom painter class
             child: Container(
               width: 300,
               height: 400,
               padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
               child: Column(
                 children: [
                   Text(
                     'My Movie',
                     style: TextStyle(
                       fontSize: 24,
                       fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                     ),
                   ),
                   SizedBox(height: 16),
                   Text('Description of the movie'),
                   SizedBox(height: 16),
                   ElevatedButton(
                     onPressed: () {
                       // Action to start streaming the movie
                     },
                     child: Text('Stream Movie'),
                   ),
                 ],
               ),
             ),
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }

   class MovieStreamingPainter extends CustomPainter {
     @override
     void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
       // Custom painting logic here
     }

     @override
     bool shouldRepaint(MovieStreamingPainter oldDelegate) => false;
   }
   ```

4. **Run the app** by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```dart
   flutter run
   ```

   This will launch the app in the simulator or on your connected device.

5. **Customize the `MovieStreamingPainter` class** to define the custom UI elements and animations for your movie streaming app. You can use various painting methods and tools provided by Flutter's canvas to create unique visuals.

6. **Add interactivity** to your app by implementing actions for the buttons or other user interface elements.

That's it! You've successfully built a custom movie streaming app UI using Flutter Custom Painter. Now you can experiment with different painting techniques and animations to make your app visually appealing and engaging.

Remember to optimize your app for performance and responsiveness to provide a seamless user experience.
