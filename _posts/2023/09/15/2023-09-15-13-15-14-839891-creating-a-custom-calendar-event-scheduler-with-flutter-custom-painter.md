In this blog post, we will explore how to create a custom calendar event scheduler using the Flutter Custom Painter widget. This will allow us to visually represent events on a calendar in a more customized and interactive way. Let's get started!

## Understanding the Flutter Custom Painter

The Custom Painter widget in Flutter allows us to create custom graphics and animations by implementing the `paint` method. This method is called by Flutter whenever the widget needs to be repainted. It provides a `Canvas` object that we can use to draw our custom graphics.

## Setting up the Project

Before we dive into the implementation, let's set up a new Flutter project following these steps:

1. Create a new Flutter project using the Flutter command line tool.
```
flutter create custom_calendar
```

2. Open the project in your favorite IDE, such as Visual Studio Code or Android Studio.

3. Modify the `lib/main.dart` file with the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(CustomCalendarApp());
}

class CustomCalendarApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Calendar Event Scheduler',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: CustomCalendarScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CustomCalendarScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Custom Calendar Event Scheduler'),
      ),
      body: Container(
        child: CustomPaint(
          painter: CustomCalendarPainter(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CustomCalendarPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // TODO: Implement the custom painting logic.
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return true;
  }
}
```

## Implementing the Custom Calendar Event Scheduler

Now that we have set up the project and created the necessary files, we can start implementing the custom painting logic for our calendar event scheduler.

### Step 1: Drawing the Calendar Grid

Our first task is to draw the calendar grid with the days and time slots. We can accomplish this by calculating the positions and sizes of each cell in the grid and then using the `canvas.drawRect()` method to draw each cell.

```dart
class CustomCalendarPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final cellWidth = size.width / 7; // Divide the width into 7 equal-sized cells
    final cellHeight = size.height / 24; // Divide the height into 24 equal-sized cells

    // Draw the calendar grid
    for (var i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
      for (var j = 0; j < 24; j++) {
        final rect = Rect.fromLTWH(i * cellWidth, j * cellHeight, cellWidth, cellHeight);
        final paint = Paint()
          ..color = Colors.grey
          ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke;

        canvas.drawRect(rect, paint);
      }
    }
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return true;
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Drawing the Events

Next, we need to implement the logic for drawing the events on the calendar. We can do this by providing the necessary data to the `CustomCalendarPainter` class.

```dart
class CustomCalendarPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final List<CalendarEvent> events;

  CustomCalendarPainter(this.events);

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Draw the calendar grid

    // Draw the events
    for (var event in events) {
      final rect = Rect.fromLTWH(
        event.day * cellWidth,
        event.startTime * cellHeight,
        cellWidth,
        (event.endTime - event.startTime) * cellHeight,
      );
      final paint = Paint()..color = event.color;

      canvas.drawRect(rect, paint);
    }
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return true;
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Using the Custom Calendar Painter

To use the custom calendar painter in our app, we can pass a list of `CalendarEvent` objects to the `CustomCalendarPainter` constructor and update the `CustomCalendarScreen` widget to include these events.

```dart
class CustomCalendarScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<CalendarEvent> events = [
    CalendarEvent(day: 0, startTime: 8, endTime: 10, color: Colors.blue),
    CalendarEvent(day: 1, startTime: 13, endTime: 16, color: Colors.green),
    CalendarEvent(day: 2, startTime: 19, endTime: 20, color: Colors.red),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Custom Calendar Event Scheduler'),
      ),
      body: Container(
        child: CustomPaint(
          painter: CustomCalendarPainter(events),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CalendarEvent {
  final int day; // 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.
  final int startTime; // Start time in 24-hour format
  final int endTime; // End time in 24-hour format
  final Color color;

  CalendarEvent({required this.day, required this.startTime, required this.endTime, required this.color});
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to create a custom calendar event scheduler using the Flutter Custom Painter widget. We implemented the logic for drawing the calendar grid and events and customized the appearance using colors and sizes. With this knowledge, you can now create your own interactive and visually appealing calendar event scheduler in Flutter!
