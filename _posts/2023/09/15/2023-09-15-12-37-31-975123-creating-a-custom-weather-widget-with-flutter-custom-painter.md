Weather widgets are a popular feature in many mobile applications, providing users with real-time weather information at a glance. With Flutter's powerful Custom Painter, you can create your own custom weather widget to add a unique touch to your app's design. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of creating a custom weather widget using Flutter Custom Painter.

## Installation

To get started, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can download Flutter from the official website and follow the installation instructions.

## Setting Up the Project

Once Flutter is installed, create a new Flutter project by running the following command:

```bash
flutter create weather_widget
```

Navigate to the newly created project directory:

```bash
cd weather_widget
```

Open the project in your preferred code editor.

## Creating a Custom Painter

1. Create a new Dart file called `weather_painter.dart`.

2. Import the necessary Flutter packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'dart:math';
```

3. Create a new class called `WeatherPainter` and extend it from `CustomPainter`.

```dart
class WeatherPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Weather widget drawing code goes here
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

4. Implement the `paint` method to draw the weather widget. For example, let's draw a simple sun icon at the center of the canvas:

```dart
@override
void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  final double centerX = size.width / 2;
  final double centerY = size.height / 2;

  final sunRadius = min(centerX, centerY) * 0.8;

  final sunPaint = Paint()
    ..color = Colors.yellow
    ..strokeWidth = 5
    ..style = PaintingStyle.fill;

  canvas.drawCircle(Offset(centerX, centerY), sunRadius, sunPaint);
}
```

5. Update the `shouldRepaint` method to return `true` if the widget should be repainted:

```dart
@override
bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
  return true;
}
```

## Using the Custom Painter Widget

1. Open your main Dart file and import the `weather_painter.dart` file:

```dart
import 'weather_painter.dart';
```

2. Replace the `MyApp` class with the following code to use the Custom Painter widget:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Weather Widget',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Custom Weather Widget'),
        ),
        body: CustomPaint(
          painter: WeatherPainter(),
          child: Container(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Run the app using the following command:

```bash
flutter run
```

You should see your custom weather widget displayed on the screen with a sun icon at the center.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully created a custom weather widget using Flutter Custom Painter. You can now build upon this foundation and add additional weather elements such as clouds, raindrops, or temperature indicators to make your weather widget more visually appealing. Remember to experiment with different shapes, colors, and styles to match your app's design.
