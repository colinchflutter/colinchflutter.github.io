With the growing complexity of modern mobile apps, it's essential to provide a seamless user experience, even in the face of network connectivity issues. One way to achieve this is by handling network request state restoration in Flutter apps. By doing so, you can ensure that users can resume interrupted actions and maintain the integrity of their app interactions. In this blog post, we will explore some strategies to handle network request state restoration in Flutter.

## Understanding the Problem

When a network request is in progress, it's crucial to maintain its state to handle interruptions, such as network failures or app termination. Restoring the network request state enables users to continue from where they left off without losing any data. To achieve this in Flutter, we need to consider the following:

1. **Persistent Storage**: Store the network request state in a persistent storage mechanism, such as a local database or shared preferences, to preserve the request data.
2. **Request Dependencies**: Ensure that all the necessary dependencies for the request, such as headers, payload, and authorization tokens, are stored along with the state.
3. **Transaction Management**: Maintain the request state, including information like request ID, status, progress, and any additional metadata, to accurately restore and track the progress of the network request.

## Implementation Steps

Let's outline the steps to handle network request state restoration in a Flutter app:

### 1. Store Request State

Whenever a network request is initiated, store its state and necessary dependencies in a persistent storage mechanism. This could be a local database or shared preferences. Serialize and store the request details, such as URL, headers, body, and any relevant metadata.

### 2. Track Request Progress

To ensure accurate restoration, track the progress of the request. Store details like request ID, status (pending, completed, failed), and progress indicators (bytes uploaded/downloaded) in the persistent storage.

### 3. Handle Interruptions

Detect interruptions, such as network failures or app termination, and handle them gracefully. When the app is reopened or network connectivity is restored, check the stored request state and resume the pending requests.

### 4. Display Progress Feedback

When the restored request is in progress, provide visual feedback to the user. Show progress indicators, like a loading spinner or a progress bar, to indicate that the request is being processed.

### 5. Handle Request Completion

Once the request is completed or fails, update the stored state accordingly. Finalize any necessary actions, like notifying the user about the success or failure, and clean up the stored request state.

## Conclusion

Handling network request state restoration is crucial for providing a seamless user experience in Flutter apps. By implementing strategies like storing request state, tracking progress, and handling interruptions, you can ensure users can resume interrupted actions and maintain data integrity. This enables your app to handle network connectivity issues gracefully and deliver a consistent experience to your users.
