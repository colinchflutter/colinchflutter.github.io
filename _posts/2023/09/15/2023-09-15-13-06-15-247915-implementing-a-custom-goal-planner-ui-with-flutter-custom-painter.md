In this tutorial, we will explore how to create a custom goal planner UI using Flutter's Custom Painter. With Custom Painter, we can create complex and interactive UI components by drawing directly on the canvas.

Custom Painter is a powerful widget in Flutter that allows us to create custom UI elements, including charts, gauges, and in this case, a goal planner. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Setting up the Flutter project

To begin, make sure you have a Flutter project set up on your machine. If not, you can follow the official [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to install Flutter.

## Step 2: Creating a new Flutter Custom Painter widget

In your Flutter project, create a new file called `goal_planner.dart`. Inside this file, create a new class called `GoalPlanner` and extend it from `CustomPainter`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class GoalPlanner extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Custom painting logic
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(GoalPlanner oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Implementing the paint method

In the `CustomPainter` subclass, the `paint` method is where we define the actual drawing of our custom UI. In this case, we will use it to draw a goal planner UI.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class GoalPlanner extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Custom painting logic
    // Draw the goal planner UI components
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(GoalPlanner oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Customizing goal planner UI

Now, let's start adding the custom logic to draw the goal planner UI components. For example, we can define the colors, shapes, and positions of the UI elements.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class GoalPlanner extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Custom painting logic
    // Draw the goal planner UI components
    
    final background = Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, size.width, size.height);
    final backgroundPaint = Paint()..color = Colors.blue;
    canvas.drawRect(background, backgroundPaint);

    final goalBox = Rect.fromLTWH(50, 50, size.width - 100, size.height - 100);
    final goalPaint = Paint()..color = Colors.white;
    canvas.drawRect(goalBox, goalPaint);
    
    // Draw more UI components as needed
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(GoalPlanner oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Using the GoalPlanner widget

To display our custom goal planner UI, we simply need to add the `GoalPlanner` widget to our Flutter app. For example, we can add it to a `Container` widget within the app's `build` method.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class GoalPlannerDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Goal Planner"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Container(
          width: 300,
          height: 400,
          child: CustomPaint(
            painter: GoalPlanner(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

That's it! We have successfully implemented a custom goal planner UI using Flutter Custom Painter. Feel free to customize the drawing logic and add more UI components as per your requirements.
