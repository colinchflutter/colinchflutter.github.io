In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a custom finance tracker user interface (UI) using **Flutter Custom Painter**. Flutter provides a powerful set of tools to create custom UI components, and Flutter Custom Painter is one such tool that allows us to create and customize complex shapes, paths, and graphics within a widget.

## Getting Started

To start building the custom finance tracker UI, make sure you have **Flutter** and **Dart** installed on your machine. If you haven't already, you can install them by following the official Flutter installation guide: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Create a new Flutter project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter create finance_tracker_ui
```

## Setting up the Project

After creating the Flutter project, open the project directory in your preferred code editor. Open the `lib/main.dart` file and remove the default code inside the `MyApp` class.

## Creating the Finance Tracker UI Widget

We will create a new widget called `FinanceTrackerUI` which extends the `CustomPainter` class. This widget will be responsible for drawing the custom finance tracker UI.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class FinanceTrackerUI extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Draw the finance tracker UI
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Implementing the `paint` Method

Inside the `paint` method of the `FinanceTrackerUI` class, we will define the various shapes and paths required to draw the finance tracker UI. This method is called whenever the widget needs to be painted.

```dart
@override
void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  final width = size.width;
  final height = size.height;

  // Define the colors
  final backgroundColor = Colors.blue;
  final foregroundColor = Colors.white;
  final chartColor = Colors.green;

  // Draw the background
  final backgroundPaint = Paint()..color = backgroundColor;
  canvas.drawRect(Offset.zero & size, backgroundPaint);

  // Draw the main content
  final foregroundPaint = Paint()..color = foregroundColor;
  canvas.drawRect(Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, width, height * 0.8), foregroundPaint);

  // Draw the chart
  final chartPaint = Paint()..color = chartColor;
  canvas.drawRect(Rect.fromLTWH(0, height * 0.8, width, height * 0.2), chartPaint);

  // Draw other UI elements
  // ...

  // Add text labels
  // ...

  // Add icon buttons
  // ...
}
```

## Adding the Custom Painter Widget

To show the custom finance tracker UI on the screen, we need to add the `CustomPaint` widget to the widget tree within the `build` method of the main app.

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Finance Tracker',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Finance Tracker'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomPaint(
            painter: FinanceTrackerUI(),
            child: Container(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Running the App

Save the changes and run the app using the following command:

```bash
flutter run
```

You should now see the custom finance tracker UI on your device or emulator.

## Conclusion

Flutter Custom Painter provides a powerful way to create custom UI components and graphics in your Flutter apps. In this tutorial, we learned how to create a custom finance tracker UI using Flutter Custom Painter.
