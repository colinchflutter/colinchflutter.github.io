If you want to build an image editor application using Flutter, you can leverage the power of Flutter Custom Painter to create a custom image editing interface. Flutter Custom Painter allows you to draw custom graphics, shapes, and images on a canvas.

In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to implement a custom image editor using Flutter Custom Painter. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can check if Flutter is installed by running the command `flutter --version` in your terminal or command prompt.

## Step 1: Setup a new Flutter project

Create a new Flutter project by running the command `flutter create custom_image_editor` in your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the project directory using `cd custom_image_editor`.

## Step 2: Add dependencies

Open the `pubspec.yaml` file in your project and add the following dependencies:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_custom_paint: ^0.4.0
```

Save the file and run `flutter packages get` in your terminal or command prompt to fetch the dependencies.

## Step 3: Create the custom image editor widget

Create a new Dart file called `image_editor.dart` in the `lib` directory. Add the following code to define the custom image editor widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/rendering.dart';
import 'package:flutter_custom_paint/flutter_custom_paint.dart';

class ImageEditor extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ImageEditorState createState() => _ImageEditorState();
}

class _ImageEditorState extends State<ImageEditor> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Custom Image Editor'),
      ),
      body: GestureDetector(
        onPanUpdate: (DragUpdateDetails details) {
          setState(() {
            // Logic to update the canvas.
          });
        },
        child: CustomPaint(
          painter: ImageEditorPainter(),
          child: Container(
            // Your image goes here.
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ImageEditorPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Logic to paint the image and custom graphics.
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return true;
  }
}
```

In this code, we define the `ImageEditor` widget as a `StatefulWidget` and override its `build` method. The `body` of the widget contains a `GestureDetector` that captures the pan gestures on the canvas and updates the canvas accordingly. The `CustomPaint` widget is used to draw the custom graphics on the canvas using the `ImageEditorPainter` class.

## Step 4: Use the custom image editor widget

In the `main.dart` file, replace the default `MyApp` widget with the `ImageEditor` widget. Your code should now look like this:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:custom_image_editor/image_editor.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Image Editor',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: ImageEditor(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Run the app

Save all the changes and run the app using `flutter run` command in your terminal or command prompt. You should see your custom image editor with an empty canvas.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to implement a custom image editor using Flutter Custom Painter. You can customize the image editor to add features like drawing, cropping, resizing, and applying filters to images. With Flutter's powerful custom painting capabilities, the possibilities are endless.
