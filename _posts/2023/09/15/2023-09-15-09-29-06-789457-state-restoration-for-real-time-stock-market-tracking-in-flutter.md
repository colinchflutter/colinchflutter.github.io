As Flutter continues to gain popularity for developing cross-platform mobile applications, it is crucial to utilize its powerful features effectively. One such feature is state restoration, which allows us to preserve the state of an application even if it gets terminated or put in the background.

In this blog post, we will explore how we can leverage state restoration in a real-time stock market tracking application built with Flutter.

## What is State Restoration?

State restoration is a mechanism provided by Flutter that allows an application to save and restore its state across different sessions. It ensures that the user's progress and data are preserved even if the app is closed or restarted.

## Why is State Restoration Important for Stock Market Tracking?

For a real-time stock market tracking application, it is crucial to maintain the user's state, including their selected stocks, filters, and any customization options. Without state restoration, users would need to start from scratch every time they open the app, which can be frustrating and time-consuming.

With state restoration, a stock market tracking app can seamlessly restore the user's previous state and provide a consistent experience, even after an app restart.

## Implementing State Restoration in Flutter

To implement state restoration in our Flutter stock market tracking app, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Enable State Restoration

To enable state restoration in our app, we need to set the `restorationScopeId` property in the `MaterialApp` widget. This unique identifier keeps track of the state restoration for our app.

### Step 2: Save and Restore App State

Next, we need to save and restore the state of our app using the `RestorationMixin` provided by Flutter. This mixin helps us manage the state restoration process.

We can define a restoration bucket using the `RestorationBucket` class, which groups related pieces of state together. Then, we can add and retrieve state objects from this bucket.

For our stock market tracking app, we can save the user's selected stocks, filter options, and any other relevant state variables in the restoration bucket.

### Step 3: Handle Lifecycle Events

To ensure our app saves and restores the state at the right time, we need to handle the lifecycle events properly. Flutter provides several lifecycle event handlers such as `didChangeAppLifecycleState` and `dispose` that we can use to trigger state restoration or saving.

When our app goes into the background or gets terminated, we can save the app state. On app launch or when moving to the foreground, we can restore the state using the saved data.

## Conclusion

State restoration plays a vital role in providing a seamless user experience for real-time stock market tracking apps in Flutter. It allows us to preserve the user's state, ensuring they can continue from where they left off without any interruptions.

By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily implement state restoration in your own Flutter applications and provide your users with a consistent and intuitive app experience.
