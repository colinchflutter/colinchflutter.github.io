In a complex Flutter app, it is crucial to handle app state restoration properly, especially when the app is suspended or terminated. Flutter provides convenient mechanisms for saving and restoring the state of your app, allowing users to seamlessly pick up where they left off.

## Saving app state

To save the app state, you need to override the `didChangeAppLifecycleState` method of the `WidgetsBindingObserver` class. This method is called whenever the app lifecycle state changes, giving you the opportunity to save the necessary state information.

Here's an example of saving the app state when the app goes into the background:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<StatefulWidget> createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> with WidgetsBindingObserver {
  AppLifecycleState _appLifecycleState;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this);
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    setState(() {
      _appLifecycleState = state;
    });

    if (_appLifecycleState == AppLifecycleState.paused) {
      // Save app state here
      // [...]
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      // App content
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, we override the `didChangeAppLifecycleState` method and save the app state when the lifecycle state transitions to `AppLifecycleState.paused`.

## Restoring app state

Restoring the app state is equally important. When the app is resumed or launched again, you can retrieve the saved state and restore it.

Here's an example of how to restore the app state:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<StatefulWidget> createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> with WidgetsBindingObserver {
  AppLifecycleState _appLifecycleState;
  bool _appStateRestored = false;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this);
    _restoreAppState();
  }

  void _restoreAppState() {
    // Retrieve saved app state here
    // [...]

    setState(() {
      _appStateRestored = true;
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this);
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    setState(() {
      _appLifecycleState = state;
    });

    if (_appLifecycleState == AppLifecycleState.resumed && !_appStateRestored) {
      _restoreAppState();
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    if (!_appStateRestored) {
      return CircularProgressIndicator();
    }

    return MaterialApp(
      // Render the app with restored state
      // [...]
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, we introduce a boolean variable `_appStateRestored` to track whether the app state has been restored. We retrieve the saved app state in the `_restoreAppState` method and set `_appStateRestored` to true. In the `didChangeAppLifecycleState` method, we check if the app is resumed and the state has not been restored, then call `_restoreAppState` to restore the app state.

## Conclusion

Handling app state restoration in a complex Flutter app is crucial to provide a seamless user experience. By leveraging Flutter's lifecycle events and appropriate state management techniques, you can save and restore the app state smoothly.
