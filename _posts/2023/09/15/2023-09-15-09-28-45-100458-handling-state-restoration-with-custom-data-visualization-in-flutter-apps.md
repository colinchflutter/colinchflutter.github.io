Data visualization is critical for understanding complex data sets in mobile applications. In Flutter, you can create custom data visualizations with widgets like `CustomPaint` and `Canvas`. However, when developing such visualizations, it is essential to handle state restoration properly.

State restoration allows users to seamlessly transition between app states when interrupted or closed. While Flutter provides built-in state restoration for many widgets, handling it with custom data visualization requires some additional steps. In this blog post, we will explore the process of state restoration in Flutter apps with custom data visualization.

## Understanding State Restoration in Flutter

State restoration in Flutter allows users to return to a specific screen and continue from where they left off. It works by preserving and restoring the state of widgets even when the app is closed or destroyed. By default, Flutter provides state restoration for most built-in widgets, like `TextFormField` or `ListView`.

When it comes to custom data visualization, we need to manually preserve and restore the state. This involves saving and loading the required data when the app transitions between states.

## Saving and Loading State in Custom Data Visualization

To handle state restoration in custom data visualization, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the important state**: Identify the critical data that needs to be preserved for the data visualization component. This could include parameters like zoom level, selected items, or the current view state.

2. **Save the state**: Implement a mechanism to save the identified state when it changes. This can be done by storing the relevant data in a persistent storage solution like `SharedPreferences` or a database.

3. **Load the state**: In the `initState` or `didChangeDependencies` methods of the data visualization widget, load the previously saved state and update the visualization accordingly.

4. **Handle state changes**: Listen for state changes within the data visualization widget and update the visualization based on the updated state. For example, if the zoom level changes, redraw the visualization with the new zoom level.

## Example Implementation

Let's consider an example where we have a custom bar chart visualization. We want to preserve and restore the state of the selected bars and the current zoom level.

```dart
class BarChart extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _BarChartState createState() => _BarChartState();
}

class _BarChartState extends State<BarChart> {
  List<int> selectedBars = [];
  double zoomLevel = 1.0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    loadState();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    saveState();
    super.dispose();
  }

  void saveState() async {
    SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    await prefs.setStringList('selectedBars', selectedBars.map((e) => e.toString()).toList());
    await prefs.setDouble('zoomLevel', zoomLevel);
  }

  void loadState() async {
    SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    setState(() {
      selectedBars = prefs.getStringList('selectedBars')?.map((e) => int.parse(e))?.toList() ?? [];
      zoomLevel = prefs.getDouble('zoomLevel') ?? 1.0;
    });
  }

  void updateSelectedBars(List<int> newSelectedBars) {
    setState(() {
      selectedBars = newSelectedBars;
    });
  }

  void updateZoomLevel(double newZoomLevel) {
    setState(() {
      zoomLevel = newZoomLevel;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Custom data visualization implementation using Canvas and CustomPaint
    // Use selectedBars and zoomLevel to render the visualization appropriately
    // ...
    return CustomPaint(/* ... */);
  }
}
```

In the example above, we save the `selectedBars` and `zoomLevel` using `SharedPreferences` when the widget is disposed. We load the state in the `initState` method and update the visualization accordingly. The state can be updated using the `updateSelectedBars` and `updateZoomLevel` methods.

## Conclusion

By properly handling state restoration in custom data visualization, you can provide a seamless experience for users interacting with complex datasets. Flutter's flexibility allows for the implementation of state restoration in various scenarios, ensuring data visualization remains consistent across app interruptions.

Remember that each custom data visualization may have unique state requirements, so adapt the saving and loading process accordingly. Enhance your Flutter apps with state restoration and deliver a robust user experience.
