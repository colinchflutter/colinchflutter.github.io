As video conferencing becomes increasingly prevalent, it is essential to provide a seamless user experience. One important aspect of this is state restoration, which allows users to resume video conferencing sessions without any interruptions. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement state restoration with video conferencing in Flutter.

## What is State Restoration?

State restoration is the ability to save and restore the state of an application, allowing users to pick up where they left off even if the app is closed or the device is rebooted. It is a valuable feature that enhances user experience, especially for applications that involve ongoing sessions like video conferencing.

## Implementing State Restoration in Flutter

To implement state restoration in Flutter, we can leverage Flutter's `RestorationMixin` class. This class provides a convenient way to save and restore the state of our widgets. Here are the steps to implement state restoration with video conferencing:

### Step 1: Define State and Restoration IDs

First, we need to define the state and restoration IDs for the components involved in our video conferencing session. For example, we might have a video stream widget and a chat window widget. We can define restoration IDs for each widget to uniquely identify them during state restoration.

```dart
class VideoStreamWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  const VideoStreamWidget({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _VideoStreamWidgetState createState() => _VideoStreamWidgetState();
}

class _VideoStreamWidgetState extends State<VideoStreamWidget> with RestorationMixin {
  final RestorableBool isVideoMuted = RestorableBool(false);

  @override
  void restoreState(RestorationBucket? oldBucket, bool initialRestore) {
    registerForRestoration(isVideoMuted, 'is_video_muted');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return // Video stream implementation
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Register Restoration IDs

Next, we register the restoration IDs with Flutter's `RestorationManager`. This allows Flutter to associate the restoration IDs with their corresponding widgets.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return RestorationScope(
      restorationId: 'app',
      child: MaterialApp(
        restorationScopeId: 'app',
        title: 'Video Conferencing',
        home: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: const Text('Video Conferencing'),
          ),
          body: Column(
            children: [
              VideoStreamWidget(),
              ChatWindowWidget(),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Save and Restore State

Finally, we can utilize the saved restoration state to restore the widget's state during app lifecycle events. This ensures that our video conferencing session remains uninterrupted.

```dart
class _VideoStreamWidgetState extends State<VideoStreamWidget> with RestorationMixin {
  final RestorableBool isVideoMuted = RestorableBool(false);

  @override
  String? get restorationId => 'video_stream_widget';

  @override
  void restoreState(RestorationBucket? oldBucket, bool initialRestore) {
    registerForRestoration(isVideoMuted, 'is_video_muted');
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    isVideoMuted.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  void restoreRestorationState(RestorationBucket? oldBucket, bool initialRestore) {
    isVideoMuted.restoreState(oldBucket);
  }

  @override
  void saveRestorationState(RestorationBucket oldBucket) {
    isVideoMuted.saveState(oldBucket);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return // Video stream implementation
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

State restoration is a crucial aspect of video conferencing applications, ensuring a smooth user experience by preserving the session state. By leveraging Flutter's `RestorationMixin`, we can easily implement state restoration in our Flutter video conferencing app. This enables users to seamlessly resume their video calls, even when interruptions occur. Give it a try, and enhance the overall user experience of your video conferencing application.
