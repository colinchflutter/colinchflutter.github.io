In Flutter, building gesture-based navigation is a common requirement for many apps. However, when using gestures to navigate between different screens or pages, it's essential to handle state restoration properly. State restoration ensures that the app remembers its previous state even if the user closes and re-opens the app.

Here, we will explore some state restoration techniques for gesture-based navigation in Flutter, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## 1. Saving State using `onSaveInstanceState()`

One of the essential steps in state restoration is to save the state of the app before being destroyed. In Flutter, you can accomplish this by overriding the `didChangeAppLifecycleState` method and handling the `onSaveInstanceState` callback.

```dart
@override
void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
  if (state == AppLifecycleState.paused) {
    _saveState(); // Save state before app is paused
  }
}

void _saveState() async {
  final preferences = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  preferences.setString('lastScreen', currentScreen);
}
```

In this example, we are using the `SharedPreferences` package to store the state. You can save the current screen or other relevant data that need to be restored later.

## 2. Restoring State using `onRestoreInstanceState()`

After the app is relaunched, you need to restore the saved state. In Flutter, you can achieve this by using the `restoreInstanceState` method provided by the `restore.dart` package.

```dart
String _lastScreen;

void _restoreState() async {
  final preferences = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  _lastScreen = preferences.getString('lastScreen');
}
```

This example demonstrates how to restore the previously saved screen. You can use the `SharedPreferences` package to retrieve the saved state and restore the appropriate screen.

## Conclusion

By following these state restoration techniques, you can ensure that your gesture-based navigation in Flutter maintains its state across app relaunches. It provides a seamless experience for users, allowing them to pick up exactly where they left off.

Implementing state restoration properly is crucial for apps with complex navigation flows, especially when using gestures. Remember to save the state before pausing the app and restore it when the app is relaunched. These techniques will ensure a smooth and uninterrupted user experience.
