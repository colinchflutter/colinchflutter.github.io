In Flutter apps, state restoration is an important feature that allows users to resume their app experience from where they left off, even if the app was closed or the device was restarted. This feature becomes even more important when using custom fonts in the app.

Custom fonts can enhance the visual appeal of an app and provide a unique branding experience. However, when the app is restarted, the custom fonts may not be loaded correctly, leading to a poor user experience. In this blog post, we will explore how to handle state restoration with custom fonts in Flutter apps.

## 1. Include Custom Fonts in your Flutter Project

Before we dive into handling state restoration, let's first ensure that our custom fonts are properly included in our Flutter project. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Create a "fonts" directory in your Flutter project's root directory.
2. Place your custom font files (e.g., .ttf, .otf) inside the "fonts" directory.
3. Update your `pubspec.yaml` file to include the custom fonts:

```yaml
flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: CustomFont
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/CustomFont-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/CustomFont-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
```

Make sure to replace "CustomFont" with the actual font family name and update the asset paths accordingly.

## 2. Restore Custom Fonts when App Restarts

To ensure that the custom fonts are correctly restored when the app restarts, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Register the Custom Fonts

In your Flutter app's main entry point (usually `main.dart`), add the following code to register the custom fonts:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await _registerCustomFonts();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

Future<void> _registerCustomFonts() async {
  final fontLoader = FontLoader('CustomFont');
  fontLoader.addFont(rootBundle.load('fonts/CustomFont-Regular.ttf'));
  fontLoader.addFont(rootBundle.load('fonts/CustomFont-Bold.ttf'));
  await fontLoader.load();
}
```

### Step 2: Set Default Font Family

In your Flutter app's `MaterialApp` widget, update the `theme` property to set the default font family:

```dart
MaterialApp(
  theme: ThemeData(
    fontFamily: 'CustomFont',
  ),
  // ...
)
```

By setting the default font family, Flutter will use the custom fonts whenever a text widget does not explicitly specify a font family.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can handle state restoration with custom fonts in your Flutter apps. This ensures that the custom fonts are correctly loaded and applied even when the app restarts, providing a seamless user experience. Remember to register the custom fonts and set the default font family in your app. Enjoy designing beautiful apps with custom fonts!
