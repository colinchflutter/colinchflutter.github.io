In Flutter, animations are an important aspect of creating visually appealing and interactive user interfaces. However, when an app undergoes state restoration, such as when the app is suspended and then resumed, animation state can be lost, resulting in a poor user experience. In this blog post, we will explore how to handle animation state restoration in Flutter.

## Understanding Animation State Restoration

When an animation is running in Flutter, it relies on the current state of the animation to determine its appearance. This state includes various parameters such as the current value, duration, and curve used for the animation. When an app is suspended and then resumed, these animation states are typically lost, resulting in animations starting from their initial state.

## Saving and Restoring Animation State

To handle animation state restoration, Flutter provides the `TickerProviderStateMixin` mixin, which adds support for managing `Ticker`s in a `StatefulWidget` by implementing the `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin` interface. By using this mixin, we can save and restore the animation state when the app is suspended and resumed.

To save the animation state, we can override the `didUpdateWidget` method in our `StatefulWidget` and store the necessary animation properties, such as the current value, in our state object. 

```dart
class MyAnimatedWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAnimatedWidgetState createState() => _MyAnimatedWidgetState();
}

class _MyAnimatedWidgetState extends State<MyAnimatedWidget> with TickerProviderStateMixin {
  AnimationController _controller;
  Animation<double> _animation;

  double _savedValue;

  @override
  void initState() {
    _controller = AnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 1),
      vsync: this,
    );
    _animation = Tween<double>(begin: 0, end: 1).animate(_controller);

    if (_savedValue != null) {
      _controller.value = _savedValue;
    }

    super.initState();
  }

  @override
  void didUpdateWidget(MyAnimatedWidget oldWidget) {
    super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget);
    
    _savedValue = _controller.value;
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AnimatedBuilder(
      animation: _animation,
      builder: (context, child) {
        return MyCustomWidget(value: _animation.value);
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we save the value of the animation in the `_savedValue` variable in the `_MyAnimatedWidgetState`. Then, during the initialization process, we set the value of the animation controller to the saved value, ensuring that the animation continues from its previous state.

## Conclusion

Handling animation state restoration in Flutter is crucial to provide a seamless user experience when an app is suspended and resumed. By using the `TickerProviderStateMixin` and properly saving and restoring animation state, we can ensure that animations continue smoothly after the app is restored.
