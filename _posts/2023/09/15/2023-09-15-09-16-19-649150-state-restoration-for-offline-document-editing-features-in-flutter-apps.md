As mobile applications become more feature-rich, allowing users to edit documents offline is a crucial functionality. However, when users go offline and then return to the app, it is essential to restore their previous state accurately. This is where state restoration comes into play.

## Why State Restoration Matters

State restoration ensures a seamless user experience by preserving the user's work and maintaining the app's state when connectivity is lost. This includes preserving unsaved changes, scroll positions, selected items, and any other relevant user data.

## Implementing State Restoration in Flutter

Flutter, being a cross-platform UI toolkit, provides a straightforward way to implement state restoration. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Enable State Restoration**

To enable state restoration in your Flutter app, you need to set `true` for the `restorationScopeEnabled` property in your `MaterialApp` widget. This tells Flutter that you want to preserve and restore the app's state.

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      restorationScopeEnabled: true,
      // the rest of your app configuration
    );
  }
}
```

2. **Add Restoration IDs**

Every widget that needs to be restored requires a unique restoration ID. You can assign these manually or generate them programmatically based on the widget's properties. Make sure to assign restoration IDs consistently between app sessions to ensure proper restoration.

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyWidget({Key? key, required this.restorationId}) : super(key: key);

  final String restorationId;

  @override
  _MyWidgetState createState() => _MyWidgetState();
}
```

3. **Implement RestorationLogic**

Next, you need to implement the restoration logic for each widget. In the `StatefulWidget`'s state class, override the `restoreState` and `saveState` methods. These methods will be called by the framework to save and restore the widget's state.

```dart
class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> with RestorationMixin {
  final RestorableInt _counter = RestorableInt(0);

  @override
  String get restorationId => widget.restorationId;

  @override
  void restoreState(RestorationBucket? oldBucket, bool initialRestore) {
    registerForRestoration(_counter, 'counter');
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _counter.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  void saveState(Re
