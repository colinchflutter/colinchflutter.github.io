When developing mobile applications using Flutter, you might come across scenarios where you need to display different types of widgets in a single list. One way to achieve this is by using a `ListView.builder` and dynamically selecting the appropriate widget based on the item's type.

In this blog post, we will walk through how to display different types of widgets in a single `ListView` in Flutter. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Define a Data Model

First, let's define a data model that represents the items we want to display in the list. Each item will have a type and corresponding data.

```dart
class ListItem {
  final String type;
  final dynamic data;

  ListItem(this.type, this.data);
}
```

The `ListItem` class has two properties: `type` which represents the type of widget to display, and `data` which stores the data specific to that widget type.

## Step 2: Create Widget Builders

Next, we need to create widget builders for each type of widget we want to display. These builders will take the `data` parameter and return the corresponding widget.

Here's an example of two widget builders, one for displaying text and another for displaying images:

```dart
Widget buildTextWidget(dynamic data) {
  return Text(data);
}

Widget buildImageWidget(dynamic data) {
  return Image.network(data);
}
```

## Step 3: Build the ListView

Now, let's build the `ListView` using the `ListView.builder` constructor. Inside the `itemBuilder` parameter, we will determine the type of the item and call the appropriate widget builder.

```dart
ListView.builder(
  itemCount: items.length,
  itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
    final item = items[index];

    switch (item.type) {
      case 'text':
        return buildTextWidget(item.data);
      case 'image':
        return buildImageWidget(item.data);
      // Add more cases for other widget types
      default:
        return Container();
    }
  },
)
```

In this example, `items` is a list of `ListItem` objects, each having a `type` and `data`. We iterate through the items and check the type to decide which widget builder to use.

## Conclusion

By using a `ListView.builder` and dynamically selecting the appropriate widget builder based on the item's type, you can easily display different types of widgets in a single list in Flutter. This approach allows for flexible and customizable list views in your Flutter applications.

Remember to define a data model to represent the items, create widget builders for each type of widget, and use the `ListView.builder` constructor to build the list. With this technique, you can create engaging and dynamic lists in your Flutter applications.
