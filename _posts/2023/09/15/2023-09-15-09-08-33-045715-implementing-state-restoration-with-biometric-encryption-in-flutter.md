In today's digital world, ensuring the security of user data is of utmost importance. One way to achieve this is by using biometric encryption to protect sensitive information. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement state restoration with biometric encryption in a Flutter application.

## Why State Restoration?

State restoration is the process of preserving the state of an application and restoring it to its previous state after the app is closed or restarted. This is crucial for providing a seamless user experience, especially in scenarios where the app needs to handle sensitive data.

## Biometric Encryption

Biometric encryption is a technique that uses biometric data (such as fingerprints or facial recognition) to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information. By utilizing the unique biometric features of a user, biometric encryption adds an extra layer of security to ensure that only authorized users can access the decrypted data.

## Implementing State Restoration with Biometric Encryption in Flutter

To implement state restoration with biometric encryption in Flutter, we can follow these steps:

### 1. Configure State Restoration

Enable state restoration in your Flutter app by adding the following code to the `main` function in your `main.dart` file:

```dart
void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  enableFlutterDriverExtension();
  runApp(App());
}
```
### 2. Encrypt the Sensitive Data

Next, we need to encrypt the sensitive data that we want to protect. You can use the `encrypt` package in Flutter to perform encryption and decryption operations. Here's an example of encrypting data using AES encryption:

```dart
import 'package:encrypt/encrypt.dart';

final key = Key.fromUtf8('your-secret-key');
final iv = IV.fromLength(16);
final encrypter = Encrypter(AES(key));

String encryptedData = encrypter.encrypt(data, iv: iv).base64;
```

### 3. Authenticate with Biometric Data

To authenticate the user with their biometric data, you can use the `local_auth` package in Flutter. This package provides methods to authenticate with fingerprint or face ID. Here's an example of biometric authentication using fingerprint:

```dart
import 'package:local_auth/local_auth.dart';

final localAuth = LocalAuthentication();

bool authenticated = await localAuth.authenticate(
  biometricOnly: true,
  localizedReason: 'Authenticate to access sensitive data',
);
```

### 4. Decrypt the Sensitive Data

Once the user is authenticated, we can decrypt the encrypted data using the previously generated encryption key and initialization vector (IV):

```dart
final decryptedData = encrypter.decrypt64(encryptedData, iv: iv);
```

### 5. Restore and Persist State

Finally, we can restore and persist the decrypted data to maintain the application state across restarts. You can use the `shared_preferences` package in Flutter to achieve this:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
prefs.setString('data', decryptedData);
```

## Conclusion

Implementing state restoration with biometric encryption adds an extra layer of security to your Flutter applications, ensuring that sensitive data is protected even when the app is closed or restarted. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can seamlessly integrate biometric encryption into your Flutter app and provide a secure user experience.
