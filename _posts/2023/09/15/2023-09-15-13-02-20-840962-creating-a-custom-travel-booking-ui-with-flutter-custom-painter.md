In this tutorial, we will explore how to create a custom travel booking user interface (UI) using Flutter Custom Painter. Flutter Custom Painter allows us to create complex and custom UI components by directly painting on a canvas.

## What is Flutter Custom Painter?

Flutter Custom Painter is a powerful feature in the Flutter framework that allows us to create custom UI components by painting directly on a canvas. It gives us full control over the UI appearance and allows us to create visually stunning and interactive interfaces.

## Setting up the Project

To get started, make sure you have Flutter installed on your system. If not, you can install it from the official Flutter website.

Once you have Flutter installed, create a new Flutter project and open it in your preferred code editor.

## Implementing the Custom Painter

1. Start by creating a new file called `travel_booking_painter.dart` in your project's `lib` folder.
2. In the `travel_booking_painter.dart` file, import the Flutter and Material libraries.
    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    ```
3. Create a new class called `TravelBookingPainter` that extends the `CustomPainter` class.
    ```dart
    class TravelBookingPainter extends CustomPainter {
      @override
      void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
        // Write your custom painting logic here
      }
    
      @override
      bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    ```
4. Inside the `paint` method, write the custom painting logic to create the travel booking UI. You can use various Flutter painting methods like `drawRect`, `drawPath`, and `drawCircle` to paint different shapes and elements.
5. To use the `TravelBookingPainter` in your Flutter UI, create a new `CustomPaint` widget and pass the `TravelBookingPainter` instance as its `painter` property.
    ```dart
    CustomPaint(
      painter: TravelBookingPainter(),
      child: Container(
        // Define container properties
      ),
    ),
    ```
6. Finally, use the `CustomPaint` widget in your Flutter UI hierarchy to display the custom travel booking UI.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a custom travel booking UI using Flutter Custom Painter. Flutter Custom Painter provides us with the ability to create unique and visually appealing UI components by painting directly on a canvas. With this knowledge, you can now leverage Flutter Custom Painter to create stunning and interactive user interfaces for your next Flutter project.
