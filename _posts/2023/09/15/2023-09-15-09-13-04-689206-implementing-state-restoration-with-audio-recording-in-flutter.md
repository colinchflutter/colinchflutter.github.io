In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement state restoration in a Flutter application that includes audio recording functionality. State restoration allows us to preserve the state of our application across application restarts or device configuration changes.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You also need a basic understanding of Flutter and Dart programming.

## Step 1: Set up a new Flutter project

Create a new Flutter project by running the following command:

```bash
flutter create audio_recording_app
```

## Step 2: Add required dependencies

Open the 'pubspec.yaml' file in your project and add the following dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  audioplayers: ^0.20.1
  shared_preferences: ^2.0.8
```

Save the file and run the following command to fetch the dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Step 3: Create the audio recording functionality

Create a new file called 'audio_recorder.dart' and add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:audioplayers/audioplayers.dart';
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

class AudioRecorder {
  final AudioCache _audioCache = AudioCache();
  AudioPlayer _audioPlayer = AudioPlayer();

  void startRecording() {
    // Code to start audio recording
  }
  
  void stopRecording() {
    // Code to stop audio recording
  }
  
  Future<String?> playRecording() async {
    SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    String? filePath = prefs.getString('recordingFilePath');
  
    if (filePath != null) {
      int result = await _audioPlayer.play(filePath, isLocal: true);
      if (result == 1) {
        return 'Playback started successfully';
      }
    }
  
    return 'Failed to start playback';
  }
}
```

In the code above, we have created an `AudioRecorder` class that uses the `audioplayers` package for audio recording and playback functionality. The `startRecording` and `stopRecording` methods are responsible for starting and stopping audio recording. The `playRecording` method retrieves the saved recording file path from `SharedPreferences` and plays the audio file using the `AudioPlayer` class.

## Step 4: Implement state restoration

In Flutter, state restoration can be achieved using the `RestorationMixin` and `RestorationProperty` classes. Modify the 'main.dart' file in your project as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'audio_recorder.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final AudioRecorder audioRecorder = AudioRecorder();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Audio Recording App',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Audio Recording App'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  audioRecorder.startRecording();
                },
                child: Text('Start Recording'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  audioRecorder.stopRecording();
                },
                child: Text('Stop Recording'),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  String? playbackStatus = await audioRecorder.playRecording();
                  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(content: Text(playbackStatus ?? '')),
                  );
                },
                child: Text('Play Recording'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the code above, we have added the `AudioRecorder` instance to the `MyApp` class. We call the `startRecording`, `stopRecording`, and `playRecording` methods from the corresponding buttons in the UI.

## Step 5: Test the application

Now, you can run the application on a device or emulator to test the audio recording functionality. When you record audio and exit the application, the state will be restored when you relaunch it. This allows you to resume playback and maintain the previously recorded audio file.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to implement state restoration in a Flutter application that includes audio recording functionality. By implementing state restoration, users can seamlessly resume their audio recording and playback sessions. This feature enhances the user experience and makes the application more user-friendly.
