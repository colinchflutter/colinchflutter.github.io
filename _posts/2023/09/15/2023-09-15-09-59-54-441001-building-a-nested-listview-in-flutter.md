Flutter is a versatile framework that makes it easy to create complex and interactive user interfaces. One common use case is building a nested ListView, where you have a scrollable list that contains another scrollable list. In this article, we will explore how to achieve this in Flutter.

## Step 1: Create the Data Model

First, we need to define the data model that will be used to populate our nested ListView. For the sake of simplicity, let's say we have a list of categories, and each category has a list of items. Here's an example of how the data model could look like:

```dart
class Category {
  final String title;
  final List<Item> items;

  Category({required this.title, required this.items});
}

class Item {
  final String name;
  final String description;

  Item({required this.name, required this.description});
}
```

## Step 2: Create the Widget Hierarchy

Next, we need to create the widget hierarchy that will render our nested ListView. We will use a combination of ListView.builder and ExpansionTile widgets to achieve this. Here's an example:

```dart
class NestedListView extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<Category> categories;

  NestedListView({required this.categories});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: categories.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, categoryIndex) {
        return ExpansionTile(
          title: Text(categories[categoryIndex].title),
          children: categories[categoryIndex].items.map((item) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text(item.name),
              subtitle: Text(item.description),
            );
          }).toList(),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we use ListView.builder to build the outer list of categories. For each category, we use ExpansionTile to create an expandable tile with the category title as the header and the list of items as the children.

## Step 3: Use the Widget

Finally, we can use our NestedListView widget in our app. Here's an example of how it could be used:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context){ 
    List<Category> categories = // populate the list of categories

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Nested ListView'),
        ),
        body: NestedListView(categories: categories),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of NestedListView and provide it with the list of categories. We then pass this widget as the body of our Scaffold.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have explored how to build a nested ListView in Flutter. By leveraging ListView.builder and ExpansionTile, we can easily create a scrollable list that contains another scrollable list. This technique can be used to build various UI components like nested menus, expandable lists, and more.
