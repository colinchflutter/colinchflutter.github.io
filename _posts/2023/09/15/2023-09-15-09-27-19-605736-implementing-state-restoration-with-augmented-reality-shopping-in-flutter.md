In this blog post, we will explore how to implement state restoration in a Flutter application that incorporates augmented reality (AR) shopping. State restoration allows users to resume their AR shopping experience from where they left off, even if they close the app or switch to another app.

## What is Augmented Reality Shopping?

Augmented Reality Shopping is a technology that enables users to virtually try on or visualize products in their real-world environment using their mobile devices. It enhances the online shopping experience by allowing users to see how products would look or fit in their own space before making a purchase.

## The Importance of State Restoration

Implementing state restoration is crucial for any app that involves AR shopping. When users are in the middle of trying on virtual products, it can be frustrating for them to lose their progress if the app is closed or gets interrupted. State restoration ensures a seamless user experience by preserving the app's state and allowing users to pick up where they left off.

## Implementing State Restoration in Flutter

1. Import the `flutter/widgets.dart` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
```

2. Create a `RestorableARState` class that extends `RestorableListenable`:

```dart
class RestorableARState<T extends ChangeNotifier> extends RestorableListenable<T> {
  @override
  T createDefaultValue() => null;

  @override
  T fromPrimitives(Object data) {
    if (data == null) return null;
    // Extract and return the state from the saved data.
    // Convert the data type if necessary.
  }

  @override
  Object toPrimitives() {
    if (value == null) return null;
    // Convert the state to a primitive representation (e.g., JSON).
    // Return the primitive value.
  }
}
```

3. Create a `RestorableARStateScope` class that extends `RestorableListenable`:

```dart
class RestorableARStateScope<T extends ChangeNotifier>
    extends RestorableListenable<T> {
  @override
  T createDefaultValue() => null;

  @override
  T fromPrimitives(Object data) {
    if (data == null) return null;
    // Extract and return the state from the saved data.
    // Convert the data type if necessary.
  }

  @override
  Object toPrimitives() {
    if (value == null) return null;
    // Convert the state to a primitive representation (e.g., JSON).
    // Return the primitive value.
  }
}
```

4. Wrap your app's root widget with the `RestorableARStateScope` widget in `main.dart`:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return RestorableARStateScope<MyAppState>(
      restorationId: 'app_state',
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'AR Shopping',
        home: ARHomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

5. Make sure your AR view widget implements the `ARSessionDelegate` protocol to handle state preservation and restoration. Use the `RestorableARStateScope` instance to access and manage the app's state.

```dart
class ARViewWidget extends StatelessWidget with ARSessionDelegate {
  final RestorableARStateScope<MyAppState> _state =
      RestorableARStateScope<MyAppState>.currentState;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize AR session and other required dependencies.
    // Load previously saved session state if it exists.
    final savedState = _state.value;
    if (savedState != null) {
      // Restore session state from savedState.
    } else {
      // Start a new AR session.
    }
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Clean up resources and save session state if necessary.
    _state.value = // Save session state.
    super.dispose();
  }

  // Implement other AR session delegate methods.

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ARSession(
      delegate: this,
      // Configure the AR session settings and customize the UI.
    );
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Implementing state restoration in a Flutter app that incorporates augmented reality shopping is crucial for providing a seamless user experience. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can ensure that your app preserves and restores the AR session state, allowing users to resume their virtual shopping experience from where they left off. Incorporating state restoration will help enhance user satisfaction and engagement with your AR shopping app.
