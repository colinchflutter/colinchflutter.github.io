In this blog post, we will discuss how to implement state restoration with *NFC* (Near Field Communication) in *Flutter*. NFC is a technology that allows two devices to communicate when they are close to each other. State restoration refers to the ability of an application to save and restore its state, so that users can continue where they left off after restarting the app or switching between different devices.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:
- Flutter SDK installed on your machine
- NFC-enabled devices or emulators

## Steps to Implement State Restoration with NFC in Flutter

### 1. Add NFC package to your Flutter project
First, you need to add the *nfc_manager* package to your Flutter project. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```dart
dependencies:
  nfc_manager: ^2.0.2
```

Save the file and run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### 2. Request NFC permission
To use NFC in your application, you need to request permission from the user. Add the following code to your app's main file:

```dart
import 'package:nfc_manager/nfc_manager.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await NfcManager.instance.startSession(
    onDiscovered: (NfcTag tag) {
      // Handle NFC tag discovery
    },
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This code initializes the NFC session and starts listening for NFC tag discovery events.

### 3. Save and restore app state with NFC tag
Next, we need to handle saving and restoring app state using NFC tags. We will use the Flutter `SharedPreferences` package to save and retrieve app state. Add the following code to your main widget:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  String appState = '';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadStateFromNfc();
  }

  void _loadStateFromNfc() async {
    SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    if (prefs.containsKey('appState')) {
      setState(() {
        appState = prefs.getString('appState') ?? '';
      });
    }
  }

  void _saveStateToNfc(String newState) async {
    SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    await prefs.setString('appState', newState);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'NFC State Restoration',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('NFC State Restoration'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(appState),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            _saveStateToNfc('New state');
          },
          child: Icon(Icons.save),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code defines a basic Flutter app with a floating action button that saves a new state to the NFC tag when pressed. The app state is loaded from the NFC tag when the app starts.

### 4. Test the app with NFC tags
Finally, you can test your app with NFC tags. Make sure you have NFC-enabled devices (or emulators) connected. Run the app, place an NFC tag near your device, and press the floating action button to save the state to the tag.

Next, restart the app or run it on a different device, and bring the NFC tag near the device. The app should automatically restore the saved state from the NFC tag.

## Conclusion
Implementing state restoration with NFC in Flutter allows users to seamlessly continue their app experience across devices. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can easily add NFC state restoration to your Flutter application. Remember to handle edge cases and ensure good user experience when working with NFC technology.
