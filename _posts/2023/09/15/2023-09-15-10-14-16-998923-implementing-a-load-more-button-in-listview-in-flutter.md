Are you building a Flutter application with a ListView that displays a large amount of data? If so, you may have encountered performance issues or a long initial load time. One way to address this issue is by implementing a load-more button in your ListView. In this tutorial, I will show you how to achieve this in Flutter.

## Step 1: Create a ListView with Initial Items

First, create a ListView widget and populate it with a fixed number of initial items. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume we have a list of items stored in a `List` variable called `data`.

```dart
ListView.builder(
  itemCount: initialItemCount,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return ListTile(
      title: Text(data[index]),
    );
  },
),
```

## Step 2: Add a Load-More Button

Next, add a load-more button at the bottom of the ListView. This button will be initially hidden and will only be displayed when there are more items to load.

```dart
bool showLoadMoreButton = false;

// ...

ListView.builder(
  itemCount: initialItemCount,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return ListTile(
      title: Text(data[index]),
    );
  },
),
Visibility(
  visible: showLoadMoreButton,
  child: RaisedButton(
    onPressed: () {
      // Load more items here
    },
    child: Text('Load More'),
  ),
)
```

## Step 3: Implement Load More Functionality

In the `onPressed` callback of the load-more button, implement the logic to load more items from the data source. This may involve fetching data from an API, loading data from a database, or any other data retrieval mechanism.

```dart
int itemCount = initialItemCount;

void loadMoreItems() {
  // Load more items from data source
  // Assuming newItems is a List of new items fetched from the data source
  List<String> newItems = fetchMoreItems();

  // Update the ListView
  setState(() {
    data.addAll(newItems);
    itemCount = data.length;

    // Check if there are still more items to load
    showLoadMoreButton = (itemCount < totalItemCount);
  });
}
```

## Final Thoughts

By implementing a load-more button in your ListView, you can improve the performance and user experience of your Flutter application when dealing with a large amount of data. Remember to handle error cases and gracefully display any loading indicators if necessary.
