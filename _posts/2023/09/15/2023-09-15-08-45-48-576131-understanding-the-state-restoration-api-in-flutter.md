Flutter is an open-source UI framework developed by Google that helps developers build beautiful and high-performance mobile applications. One important feature of Flutter is its state restoration API, which allows apps to automatically save and restore their state across different app launches or device orientations. In this blog post, we will explore the state restoration API in Flutter and understand how to use it effectively.

## What is State Restoration in Flutter?

State restoration refers to the ability of an app to save its current state and restore it later. This can be crucial in scenarios where the user temporarily leaves the app or when the device undergoes a configuration change, such as rotating the screen from portrait to landscape mode.

In Flutter, state restoration can be achieved using the `Restorable` and `RestorableProperty` classes. The `Restorable` class represents an object whose state needs to be saved and restored, while the `RestorableProperty` class defines a property of the object that should be saved and restored. By annotating the desired properties with `@protected`, the state restoration system knows which properties to persist.

## Using the State Restoration API

To use the state restoration API in Flutter, follow these steps:

1. Create a subclass of `RestorableProperty` for each property that needs to be saved. For example, if you want to save the state of a counter, create a `RestorableInt` property.
```dart
class MyRestorableCounter extends RestorableProperty<int> {
  @override
  int createDefaultValue() => 0;

  @override
  int fromPrimitives(Object? data) => data as int;

  @override
  Object? toPrimitives() => value;
}
```

2. Define a subclass of `RestorableState` for each widget that needs state restoration. For example, if you have a `CounterWidget`, create a `CounterState` class that extends `RestorableState`.
```dart
class CounterState extends RestorableState<CounterWidget> {
  final MyRestorableCounter _counter = MyRestorableCounter();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _counter.addListener(updateModel);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _counter.removeListener(updateModel);
    super.dispose();
  }

  void updateModel() {
    if (_counter.value == widget.maxValue) {
      // Perform a specific action when the counter reaches the max value
    }
    // Save the state whenever the counter updates
    saveState();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(_counter.value.toString());
  }

  @override
  void restoreState(RestorationBucket? oldBucket, bool initialRestore) {
    registerForRestoration(_counter, 'counter');
  }
}
```

3. Use the `RestorableState` subclass in your widget's `createState` method.
```dart
class CounterWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  final int maxValue;

  CounterWidget({required this.maxValue});

  @override
  CounterState createState() => CounterState();
}
```

## Conclusion

State restoration is a powerful feature of Flutter that allows apps to seamlessly save and restore their state. By using the state restoration API, developers can ensure a smooth and uninterrupted user experience, even in scenarios where the app is temporarily closed or the device undergoes changes. Understanding and effectively using the state restoration API can greatly enhance the robustness of your Flutter applications.
