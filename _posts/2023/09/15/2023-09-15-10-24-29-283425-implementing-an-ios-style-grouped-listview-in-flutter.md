Flutter, being a powerful cross-platform framework, allows developers to create stunning user interfaces for both Android and iOS apps. One common design pattern used in iOS apps is the grouped ListView, which provides a visually appealing way to organize and display data in sections. In this tutorial, I'll show you how to implement an iOS-style grouped ListView in a Flutter app.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have Flutter installed on your system. Then, create a new Flutter project and open it in your preferred code editor.

## Installing Dependencies

To implement the grouped ListView, we'll use the `table_view` package, which provides a flexible way to create table-like layouts with sections. To install it, add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  table_view: ^1.0.0
```

Save the file and run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

## Creating the Grouped ListView

Now, let's dive into the implementation of the iOS-style grouped ListView. Start by creating a new Dart file, such as `grouped_list_view.dart`, and import the necessary packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:table_view/table_view.dart';
```

Next, define a list of data that you want to display in the grouped ListView:

```dart
List<Map<String, dynamic>> data = [
  {'section': 'Section 1', 'items': ['Item 1', 'Item 2']},
  {'section': 'Section 2', 'items': ['Item 3', 'Item 4']},
  // Add more sections and items here if needed
];
```

Now, let's create a `GroupedTableView` widget that wraps the grouped ListView:

```dart
class GroupedListView extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Grouped ListView'),
      ),
      body: Container(
        child: TableView(
          sectionCount: data.length,
          cellAtIndexPath: (context, indexPath) {
            String item = data[indexPath.section]['items'][indexPath.row];

            return TableViewCell(
              child: ListTile(
                title: Text(item),
              ),
            );
          },
          headerInSection: (context, section) {
            String sectionTitle = data[section]['section'];

            return Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
              color: Colors.grey[200],
              child: Text(
                sectionTitle,
                style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
              ),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code, we're using the `TableView` widget from the `table_view` package. We specify the `sectionCount` to indicate the number of sections in our data list. The `cellAtIndexPath` function is called to build the cells for the items in each section. And the `headerInSection` function is used to build the headers for each section.

Finally, we need to update the `main.dart` file to display the `GroupedListView`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:your_app_name/grouped_list_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'iOS-style ListView',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: GroupedListView(),
    );
  }
}
```

And that's it! Run your app using `flutter run` and you'll see the iOS-style grouped ListView in action.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to implement an iOS-style grouped ListView in Flutter using the `table_view` package. With this knowledge, you can now create visually appealing and organized user interfaces in your Flutter apps. Happy coding!
