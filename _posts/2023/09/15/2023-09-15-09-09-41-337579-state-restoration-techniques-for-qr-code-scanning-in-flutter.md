In modern mobile applications, maintaining state across different screens and app restarts is crucial for providing a seamless user experience. This is especially important when working with QR code scanning in Flutter, where scanning may be interrupted or the app may be backgrounded. Fortunately, Flutter provides several state restoration techniques that can be utilized to handle these scenarios effectively.

## 1. Saving the QR Code Scan Result in Application State

One approach to handle state restoration is to save the scanned QR code result in the application state. This can be achieved by utilizing a state management solution like *Provider* or *Riverpod* in Flutter.

### Example Code:
```dart
// Define the QR code result model class
class QRCodeResult {
  final String data;
  
  QRCodeResult(this.data);
}

// Provider for managing the scanned QR code result
final qrCodeResultProvider = Provider<QRCodeResult>((ref) => throw UnimplementedError());

// Widget for displaying the scanned QR code result
class QRCodeResultWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final qrCodeResult = context.read(qrCodeResultProvider);
    
    return Text(qrCodeResult.data);
  }
}
```

In the example code above, we define a `QRCodeResult` class to represent the scanned QR code result. We then create a Provider named `qrCodeResultProvider` to manage the state of the scanned QR code result. This provider can be accessed by any widget in the Flutter application using the `context.read()` method.

## 2. Utilizing Flutter's State Restoration

Another powerful technique for handling state restoration in Flutter is by utilizing Flutter's built-in state restoration capabilities. This allows the framework to automatically save and restore the state of widgets and their associated data.

To enable state restoration for a QR code scanning feature, you need to:

1. Use the `RestorableRouteFuture` widget to handle the route that includes the QR code scanning screen.
2. Save and restore the relevant state in the `RestorableRouteFuture` callbacks.

### Example Code:
```dart
class QRCodeScanRoute extends StatefulWidget {
  // Restorable properties for QR code scanning screen
  static final RestorableBool isScanning = RestorableBool(false);
  static final RestorableString? scanResult = RestorableString();

  @override
  _QRCodeScanRouteState createState() => _QRCodeScanRouteState();
}

class _QRCodeScanRouteState extends State<QRCodeScanRoute> with RestorationMixin, SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  late AnimationController _animationController;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    
    // Initialize animation controller for QR code scanning animation
    _animationController = AnimationController(vsync: this, duration: Duration(seconds: 2));
    _animationController.repeat();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _animationController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
  
  @override
  String? get restorationId => 'qrCodeScanRoute';

  @override
  void restoreState(RestorationBucket? oldBucket, bool initialRestore) {
    registerForRestoration(QRCodeScanRoute.isScanning, 'is_scanning');
    registerForRestoration(QRCodeScanRoute.scanResult, 'scan_result');
  }
  
  @override
  void saveState(RestorationBucket bucket) {
    writeRestorableValue(QRCodeScanRoute.isScanning, isScanning.value);
    writeRestorableValue(QRCodeScanRoute.scanResult, scanResult.value);
    super.saveState(bucket);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return RestorableRouteFuture<void>(
      onPresent: (navigator, initial) {
        navigator.push(MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => QRCodeScanScreen()));
      },
      onPop: (result) async {
        if (navigator.restorationManager.wantKeepAlive) {
          return SynchronousFuture(true);
        }
        return SynchronousFuture<void>(null);
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In the example code above, we define a `QRCodeScanRoute` widget which implements the `RestorationMixin` and `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin`. We utilize the `RestorableBool` and `RestorableString` classes to save and restore the scanning state and result respectively. These classes automatically handle the state restoration for us.

The `RestorableRouteFuture` widget is used to handle the scanning screen's route. It allows us to define the onPresent and onPop callbacks to manage the navigation flow. We push the `QRCodeScanScreen` on the onPresent callback and handle the navigation flow on the onPop callback.

By implementing the `restorationId`, `restoreState`, and `saveState` methods, we inform Flutter about the state that needs to be restored. Flutter automatically handles the saving and restoring of the registered state.

Using the restorable properties in combination with the `RestorableRouteFuture`, we can ensure that the QR code scanning state is properly restored even when the app is restarted or the widget tree changes.

## Conclusion

Implementing state restoration techniques is essential when working with QR code scanning features in Flutter. By saving the scanned QR code result in application state or utilizing Flutter's state restoration capabilities, we can ensure a seamless user experience by preserving the scanning state across different screens and app restarts.
