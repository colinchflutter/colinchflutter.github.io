One common requirement in mobile app development is having **sticky headers** in a `ListView`. Sticky headers stay fixed at the top of the screen while scrolling through the list content. In this tutorial, we will explore how to achieve this effect in your Flutter app.

## Adding Dependencies

To achieve sticky headers in Flutter, we'll need to add a dependency called `sticky_headers` to our project. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under `dependencies`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  sticky_headers: ^0.2.0
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` in the terminal to fetch and update the project.

## Implementing Sticky Headers

To create sticky headers in `ListView`, follow these steps:

1. Import the required packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sticky_header/flutter_sticky_header.dart';
```

2. Create a `ListView.builder` widget and wrap it with a `CustomScrollView`. Inside `CustomScrollView`, pass the `slivers` as children:

```dart
CustomScrollView(
  slivers: [
    SliverStickyHeader(
      header: Container(
        height: 50,
        color: Colors.grey[300],
        alignment: Alignment.centerLeft,
        child: Text(
          'Header 1',
          style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
        ),
      ),
      sliver: SliverList(
        delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
          (BuildContext context, int index) {
            // Build your list items
            return ListTile(title: Text('Item $index'));
          },
          childCount: 10,
        ),
      ),
    ),
    // Add more SliverStickyHeader as needed
  ],
)
```

3. Customize the header and list items as per your UI requirements.

4. Repeat Step 2 to add more `SliverStickyHeader` widgets to the `slivers` list, if needed.

By following the above steps, you will now have sticky headers in your `ListView`. You can customize the appearance, behavior, and content of the headers and list items as per your app's design.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to create **sticky headers** in a `ListView` in Flutter using the `sticky_headers` package. This can enhance the user experience by providing easy navigation and context while scrolling through long lists of content.
