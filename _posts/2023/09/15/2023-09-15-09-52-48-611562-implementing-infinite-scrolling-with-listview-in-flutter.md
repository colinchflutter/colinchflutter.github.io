In many mobile apps, we often need to display a large amount of data in a scrollable list view. As users scroll down, we want to load more data to provide a seamless browsing experience. This is where infinite scrolling comes in. In this blog post, we will learn how to implement infinite scrolling with ListView in Flutter.

## Setting up the project

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have Flutter installed and set up on your machine. If not, you can follow the official Flutter documentation to get started.

## Building the ListView

Let's start by creating a basic Flutter app with a ListView widget. Open your *main.dart* file and replace the default code with the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Infinite Scrolling',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Infinite Scrolling'),
        ),
        body: ListView.builder(
          itemCount: 100, // Change it to your desired total number of items
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text('Item $index'),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter app with an AppBar and a ListView.builder widget. We have set the `itemCount` to 100, but you can change it based on your requirements.

## Implementing infinite scrolling

To implement infinite scrolling, we need to listen to the scroll position of the ListView and load more data when the user reaches the end. Modify the ListView.builder widget as follows:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  ScrollController _scrollController = ScrollController();
  List<String> items = List.generate(100, (index) => 'Item $index');

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _scrollController.addListener(_loadMoreItems);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _scrollController.removeListener(_loadMoreItems);
    _scrollController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  void _loadMoreItems() {
    if (_scrollController.position.pixels == _scrollController.position.maxScrollExtent) {
      setState(() {
        items.addAll(List.generate(20, (index) => 'Item ${items.length + index}'));
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Infinite Scrolling',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Infinite Scrolling'),
        ),
        body: ListView.builder(
          controller: _scrollController,
          itemCount: items.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text(items[index]),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, we have made the following changes:

- Converted the `MyApp` widget to a `StatefulWidget` to manage the scrolling functionality.
- Initialized a `ScrollController` and added a listener in the `initState` method.
- Implemented the `_loadMoreItems` method that gets called when the user reaches the end of the list.
- Added the `controller` property to the ListView.builder widget and passed `_scrollController` as its value.
- Updated the `itemCount` property to use the length of the `items` list.

Now, when you run the app, you'll notice that as you scroll down, new items are dynamically added to the ListView when you reach the end.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented infinite scrolling with ListView in Flutter. This technique allows you to display and load more data efficiently without overwhelming the user. Feel free to customize and enhance the code to suit your specific needs.
