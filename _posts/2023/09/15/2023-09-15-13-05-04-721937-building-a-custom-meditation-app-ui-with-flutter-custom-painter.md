With the growing popularity of meditation, many mobile apps have been developed to help users practice mindfulness. In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a custom meditation app UI using Flutter's powerful Custom Painter.

## What is Flutter Custom Painter?

Flutter Custom Painter is a powerful widget that allows you to create custom graphics and animations. It gives you full control over how your user interface looks and behaves by allowing you to paint directly on the canvas.

## Setting up the Flutter Project

Before we dive into building the meditation app UI, let's set up a new Flutter project:

```
flutter create meditation_app
cd meditation_app
```

## Creating the Custom Painter Widget

To get started, let's create a stateless widget called `MeditationUI` that extends `CustomPainter`. This widget will be responsible for painting the meditation app UI:

```dart
class MeditationUI extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Implement custom painting logic here
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

In the `paint` method, we will define our custom painting logic to draw the meditation app UI.

## Custom Painting the Meditation App UI

To create the meditation app UI, let's start by drawing a background gradient. We will use the `Paint` class to define the colors and styles:

```dart
class MeditationUI extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final paint = Paint()
      ..shader = LinearGradient(
        begin: Alignment.topCenter,
        end: Alignment.bottomCenter,
        colors: [
          Colors.blue,
          Colors.white,
          Colors.pink,
        ],
      ).createShader(Rect.fromLTRB(0, 0, size.width, size.height));

    canvas.drawRect(Rect.fromLTRB(0, 0, size.width, size.height), paint);
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

In this example, we used a linear gradient to create a background that transitions from blue to white to pink.

Next, let's add some text to the UI:

```dart
class MeditationUI extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Paint background gradient

    final textPaint = Paint()
      ..color = Colors.white
      ..style = PaintingStyle.fill
      ..textAlign = TextAlign.center;

    final textSpan = TextSpan(
      text: 'Meditation App',
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
    );

    final textPainter = TextPainter(
      text: textSpan,
      textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
    );

    textPainter.layout(minWidth: 0, maxWidth: size.width);
    textPainter.paint(canvas, Offset(size.width / 2 - textPainter.width / 2, 50));
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

In this code snippet, we created a `TextSpan` with the desired text and styling. We then used the `TextPainter` to calculate the layout and position of the text on the canvas.

## Integrating the Custom Painter Widget

Now that we have our custom painter widget ready, let's integrate it into our Flutter app. First, replace the `MyApp` class in the `main.dart` file with the following code:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Meditation App'),
        ),
        body: CustomPaint(
          painter: MeditationUI(),
          child: Container(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code creates a simple scaffold with an app bar and a custom painter widget as the body.

Finally, run the app using `flutter run` and you should see your custom meditation app UI with the background gradient and the text.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to build a custom meditation app UI using Flutter Custom Painter. We learned how to create a custom painter widget, define custom painting logic, and integrate it into a Flutter app.

Flutter Custom Painter offers endless possibilities for creating beautiful and unique user interfaces. By leveraging its power, you can create stunning visuals for your mobile apps. So go ahead and unleash your creativity with Flutter Custom Painter!
