In this tutorial, we will explore how to create a custom finance budgeting app user interface (UI) using Flutter Custom Painter. Flutter Custom Painter allows us to create complex and custom shapes, charts, and designs, making it a perfect choice for implementing a unique UI like a finance budgeting app.

## Prerequisites
* Basic knowledge of Flutter and Dart.
* Flutter development environment set up.

## Step 1: Setup Flutter Project
Before we begin, let's set up a Flutter project. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
flutter create finance_budgeting_app
```

This will create a new Flutter project named "finance_budgeting_app".

## Step 2: Create a Custom Painter Widget
Inside the `lib` directory of your Flutter project, create a new file called `budget_painter.dart`. This file will contain our custom painter widget.

Start by importing the necessary dependencies:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

Create a new class named `BudgetPainter` that extends `CustomPainter`:

```dart
class BudgetPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Your custom painting logic goes here
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(BudgetPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

You will implement the custom painting logic inside the `paint` method. This method is responsible for drawing the custom UI elements on the canvas.

## Step 3: Implement Custom Painting Logic
Inside the `paint` method of the `BudgetPainter` class, we will implement the custom painting logic to create our finance budgeting app UI.

Start by defining the colors and dimensions that you want to use for your UI:

```dart
final Color backgroundColor = Color(0xFFE0E0E0);
final Color expenseColor = Color(0xFFF44336);
final Color incomeColor = Color(0xFF4CAF50);
final double chartPadding = 32.0;
```

Next, use the provided `Canvas` object to draw your UI elements. For example, you can draw a background rectangle and two bars representing expenses and income:

```dart
final Rect backgroundRect = Offset.zero & size;
final Paint backgroundPaint = Paint()..color = backgroundColor;
canvas.drawRect(backgroundRect, backgroundPaint);

final double expenseWidth = size.width * 0.7;
final double incomeWidth = size.width * 0.3;
final double barHeight = 100.0;
final double expenseY = size.height / 2 - barHeight / 2;
final double incomeY = size.height / 2 + barHeight / 2;

final Rect expenseRect = Rect.fromLTWH(chartPadding, expenseY, expenseWidth, barHeight);
final Paint expensePaint = Paint()..color = expenseColor;
canvas.drawRect(expenseRect, expensePaint);

final Rect incomeRect = Rect.fromLTWH(chartPadding + expenseWidth, incomeY, incomeWidth, barHeight);
final Paint incomePaint = Paint()..color = incomeColor;
canvas.drawRect(incomeRect, incomePaint);
```

Feel free to customize the painting logic to match your desired UI design.

## Step 4: Use Custom Painter Widget in App
Now that our `BudgetPainter` class is ready, let's use it in our app.

Open the `main.dart` file inside the `lib` directory and replace the existing code with the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'budget_painter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Finance Budgeting App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Finance Budgeting App'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomPaint(
            painter: BudgetPainter(),
            child: Container(
              width: 300.0,
              height: 200.0,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code sets up a basic Flutter app with a centered `CustomPaint` widget that uses our `BudgetPainter` class. We also set the size of the container to 300x200 pixels, but you can adjust it to fit your needs.

## Step 5: Run the App
To see the custom finance budgeting app UI in action, run the app using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
flutter run
```

Congratulations! You have successfully created a custom finance budgeting app UI using Flutter Custom Painter. You can further enhance the UI by adding more elements, animations, and interactions based on your app's requirements.
