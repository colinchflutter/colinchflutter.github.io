Expense trackers are crucial for managing personal finances and keeping expenses in check. In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a custom expense tracker user interface (UI) using Flutter Custom Painter. 

## What is Flutter Custom Painter?

Flutter Custom Painter is a powerful widget that enables us to create custom graphics and implement complex UI designs. It gives us full control over drawing shapes, lines, curves, and text on the canvas.

## Getting Started

To begin, make sure you have Flutter installed and set up on your development environment. If you haven't done so, you can find detailed instructions in the official Flutter documentation.

Let's start by creating a new Flutter project:

```
flutter create expense_tracker_ui
```

Next, navigate to the project directory:

```
cd expense_tracker_ui
```

## Adding Dependencies

To use Flutter Custom Painter in our project, we need to add it as a dependency in the `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  custom_paint:
```

After adding the dependency, save the file and run the following command to fetch it:

```
flutter pub get
```

## Implementing the Expense Tracker UI

Open the `lib/main.dart` file and replace the existing code with the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(ExpenseTrackerApp());
}

class ExpenseTrackerApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Expense Tracker',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity,
      ),
      home: ExpenseTrackerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class ExpenseTrackerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Expense Tracker'),
      ),
      body: CustomPaint(
        painter: ExpenseTrackerPainter(),
        child: Container(
          height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height,
          width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ExpenseTrackerPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Implement your custom painting logic here
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(CustomPainter oldDelegate) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

In this example, we defined the `ExpenseTrackerApp` as the entry point for our application. It provides the title and theme for the app and sets the `ExpenseTrackerScreen` as the home screen.

Inside the `ExpenseTrackerScreen`, we have a `Scaffold` widget with an app bar and a `body` section. The body contains a `CustomPaint` widget where we'll implement our custom painting logic.

In the `ExpenseTrackerPainter` class, we override the `paint` method to define our custom painting logic. This is where you can draw shapes, lines, curves, and text on the canvas using Flutter's painting APIs.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to build a custom expense tracker UI using Flutter Custom Painter. We learned about the basics of Flutter Custom Painter and implemented a simple UI structure. With the custom painting logic in place, you can now extend the functionality and design the expense tracker UI according to your requirements.
