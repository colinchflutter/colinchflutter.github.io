Augmented Reality (AR) filters have become increasingly popular in mobile applications, providing users with interactive and engaging experiences. In Flutter, an open-source UI toolkit, developers can easily create AR filters using plugins like ARKit or ARCore. However, one challenge when building AR filters is the need to maintain the state across different app sessions or interruptions. In this blog post, we will explore some state restoration techniques in Flutter to ensure a seamless user experience for AR filters.

## 1. Saving and Restoring Filter State

One approach to preserving the state of AR filters is to save and restore the relevant data. For instance, if the filter allows the user to adjust the color intensity or apply different effects, these settings should be saved and restored when the app is relaunched. To achieve this, you can use the shared_preferences package in Flutter.

`import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';`

You can save the filter state in the `dispose` method of your filter widget, which is called when the widget is removed from the widget tree.

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  super.dispose();
  saveFilterState();
}

Future<void> saveFilterState() async {
  SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  prefs.setDouble('colorIntensity', _colorIntensity);
  prefs.setString('effect', _selectedEffect);
}
```

To restore the state, you can load the saved values in the `initState` method of your filter widget, which is called when the widget is inserted into the widget tree.

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  restoreFilterState();
}

Future<void> restoreFilterState() async {
  SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  setState(() {
    _colorIntensity = prefs.getDouble('colorIntensity');
    _selectedEffect = prefs.getString('effect');
  });
}
```

By saving and restoring the filter state using shared_preferences, you can ensure that the user's settings are preserved even if the app is closed or interrupted.

## 2. AR Session Preservation

In addition to saving and restoring filter state, it is crucial to preserve the AR session itself. AR sessions contain important information about the current state of the AR experience, including object positions, lighting conditions, and camera settings.

One way to preserve the AR session is to take advantage of Flutter's state management solutions, such as the Provider package. With Provider, you can create a centralized data model to hold the AR session state and access it from anywhere in your app.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

class ARSessionModel extends ChangeNotifier {
  ARSessionData _sessionData;

  ARSessionData get sessionData => _sessionData;

  set sessionData(ARSessionData value) {
    _sessionData = value;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

Where `ARSessionData` is a custom class defining the necessary properties to represent the AR session state.

To preserve the AR session, update the session data whenever there is a change in the session. For instance, when the user moves or interacts with virtual objects:

```dart
Provider.of<ARSessionModel>(context, listen: false).sessionData = updatedSessionData;
```

When the app is interrupted or relaunched, you can restore the AR session data by retrieving it from the data model and re-initializing the AR session using the saved data.

```dart
ARSessionData savedSessionData = Provider.of<ARSessionModel>(context, listen: false).sessionData;
// Re-initialize AR session using savedSessionData
```

By preserving the AR session using a state management solution like Provider, you can ensure that the AR experience seamlessly continues from where it left off, providing a more immersive user experience.

## Conclusion

Building augmented reality filters in Flutter provides endless possibilities for interactive and captivating user experiences. By implementing state restoration techniques, such as saving and restoring filter state, and preserving the AR session, you can create AR filters that offer a seamless experience across app sessions. Keep in mind that the specific implementation may vary depending on the requirements of your app, but these techniques serve as a solid foundation. So go ahead and build stunning AR filters that will wow your users!
