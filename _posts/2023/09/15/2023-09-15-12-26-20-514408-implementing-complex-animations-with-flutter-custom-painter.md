Flutter is a powerful framework for building cross-platform apps with beautiful and smooth user interfaces. One of the key features that Flutter offers for creating visually appealing UIs is the Custom Painter widget. With Custom Painter, you can create complex animations by **drawing directly on the canvas**.

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of implementing complex animations using Flutter Custom Painter. Let's dive in!

## Step 1: Creating a Custom Painter

To get started, we need to create a Custom Painter class that extends the `CustomPainter` base class. This class will be responsible for drawing on the canvas and animating the shapes.

```dart
class MyCustomPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // TODO: Implement your custom painting logic here
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) => false;
}
```

## Step 2: Adding Animation Properties

Next, we need to define the animation properties that will drive the animation. Flutter provides the `Animation` and `AnimationController` classes to handle animations.

```dart
class MyCustomPainter extends CustomPainter with ChangeNotifier {
  AnimationController _animationController;
  Animation<double> _animation;

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // TODO: Implement your custom painting logic here
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _animationController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Implementing the Animation Logic

Now, we can implement the animation logic inside the `paint` method. Here's an example that animates a circle's radius and color:

```dart
@override
void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  final radius = _animation.value * size.width / 2;
  final color = Colors.red.withOpacity(1 - _animation.value);

  final circle = Path()
    ..addOval(Rect.fromCircle(center: size.center(Offset.zero), radius: radius));

  canvas.drawPath(circle, Paint()..color = color);
}
```

## Step 4: Starting the Animation

To start the animation, we need to initialize the animation controller and start it:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  _animationController = AnimationController(
    vsync: this,
    duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
  );

  _animation = _animationController..addListener(() {
    notifyListeners();
  });

  _animationController.forward();
  super.initState();
}
```

## Step 5: Using the Custom Painter

Finally, we can use the Custom Painter in our Flutter widget by including it within the `CustomPaint` widget:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return CustomPaint(
    painter: MyCustomPainter(),
    child: Container(),
  );
}
```

That's it! With these steps, you can implement complex animations using Flutter Custom Painter. Experiment with different painting techniques and animation properties to create stunning visuals in your Flutter apps.
