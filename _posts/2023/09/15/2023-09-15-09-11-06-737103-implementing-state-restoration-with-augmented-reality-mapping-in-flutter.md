![AR Mapping with Flutter](https://example.com/ar-mapping.png)

Have you ever wanted to create an augmented reality (AR) app that not only provides a great user experience but also ensures that the state of the app is preserved even when the user switches between different AR scenes or navigates away from the app? Flutter provides a powerful feature called state restoration that allows you to easily save and restore the state of your app, including AR mapping data. In this blog post, we'll explore how to implement state restoration with augmented reality mapping in Flutter.

## What is state restoration?

State restoration is a technique that allows you to save and restore the state of an app across different sessions or user interactions. It can be extremely useful for apps that involve complex interactions or data that needs to be persisted across app restarts. In the context of our AR mapping app, state restoration will ensure that the mapping data, such as the user's placed objects in the AR scene, is preserved even when the app is closed and reopened.

## Setting up the AR mapping app

To get started, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. Create a new Flutter project and add the necessary dependencies for AR and state restoration. For augmented reality, you can use packages like `arcore_flutter_plugin` or `arkit_flutter`. For state restoration, you can use the `flutter_bloc` package. Once you have set up your project, you are ready to start implementing state restoration with augmented reality mapping.

## Saving the AR mapping state

To save the state of the AR mapping, we need to listen for changes in the AR scene and persist the necessary data. For example, if the user places an object in the AR scene, we can store the position and rotation of that object in a local database or shared preferences. When the app is closed, this data will be saved and can be retrieved when the app is reopened. We can use the `flutter_bloc` package to manage the state and listen for changes in the AR scene.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';

class ARMappingBloc extends Bloc<ARMappingEvent, ARMappingState> {
  @override
  ARMappingState get initialState => ARMappingState();

  @override
  Stream<ARMappingState> mapEventToState(
    ARMappingEvent event,
  ) async* {
    if (event is PlaceObjectEvent) {
      // Store the position and rotation of the placed object in the database
      await saveObject(event.object);
      
      // Emit the updated state
      yield state.copy(object: event.object);
    }
  }
}
```

## Restoring the AR mapping state

To restore the AR mapping state, we need to retrieve the saved data and recreate the AR scene with the previously placed objects. We can fetch the saved data from the local database or shared preferences and use it to initialize the AR scene. This can be done in the `initState()` method of the Flutter widget.

```dart
class ARMappingPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ARMappingPageState createState() => _ARMappingPageState();
}

class _ARMappingPageState extends State<ARMappingPage> {
  ARMappingBloc _arMappingBloc;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    
    _arMappingBloc = ARMappingBloc();
    _arMappingBloc.add(RestoreStateEvent());
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocBuilder<ARMappingBloc, ARMappingState>(
      builder: (context, state) {
        // Build the AR scene with the restored objects
        return ARScene(
          objects: state.objects,
          onObjectPlaced: (object) {
            _arMappingBloc.add(PlaceObjectEvent(object));
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to implement state restoration with augmented reality mapping in Flutter. By leveraging the power of state restoration and AR technologies, we can create apps that provide a seamless experience for users and ensure that their data is preserved even across different sessions. Flutter's ecosystem provides powerful packages like `flutter_bloc` and AR plugins that make it easy to implement such features. Now, it's your turn to dive into the world of AR mapping and create amazing experiences for your users.
