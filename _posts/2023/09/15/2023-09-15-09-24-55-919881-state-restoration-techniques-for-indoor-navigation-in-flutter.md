## Introduction
Indoor navigation apps have become increasingly popular, helping users navigate large buildings such as airports, malls, or museums. To ensure a seamless user experience, it's essential to implement state restoration techniques in your indoor navigation app built with Flutter. State restoration enables users to pick up where they left off, even if they temporarily leave the app or their device restarts. In this article, we will explore some state restoration techniques for indoor navigation in Flutter.

## Saving and Restoring State
1. **Persisting Data:** To restore the state of an indoor navigation app, you need to persist important data such as the current location, map orientation, zoom level, and destination. One approach is to use a database or shared preferences to save this data whenever it changes. Flutter provides easy-to-use plugins like `shared_preferences` or `sqflite` for this purpose.

   ```dart
   import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

   // Save location
   void saveLocation(double latitude, double longitude) async {
     SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
     await prefs.setDouble('latitude', latitude);
     await prefs.setDouble('longitude', longitude);
   }

   // Restore location
   Future<LatLng> restoreLocation() async {
     SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
     double latitude = prefs.getDouble('latitude');
     double longitude = prefs.getDouble('longitude');
     return LatLng(latitude, longitude);
   }
   ```

2. **Saving App State:** Flutter provides a built-in mechanism called `saveState` and `restoreState` to save and restore the state of your app's widgets. You can override these methods in your custom widget to save and restore relevant state information.

   ```dart
   class IndoorNavigationWidget extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     _IndoorNavigationWidgetState createState() => _IndoorNavigationWidgetState();
   }

   class _IndoorNavigationWidgetState extends State<IndoorNavigationWidget> with RestorableMixin {
     final RestorableDouble _zoomLevel = RestorableDouble(1.0);
     final RestorableBool _showDestination = RestorableBool(false);

     @override
     void restoreState(RestorationBucket oldBucket, bool initialRestore) {
       registerForRestoration(_zoomLevel, 'zoom_level');
       registerForRestoration(_showDestination, 'show_destination');
     }

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Column(
         children: [
           // Indoor map widgets
           // Navigation controls
         ],
       );
     }
   }
   ```

## Handling Device Lifecycle Events
When the user leaves the app or the device restarts, the app needs to handle lifecycle events to properly restore the state. Flutter provides the `WidgetsBindingObserver` mixin, which allows your widgets to listen to different lifecycle events like `didChangeAppLifecycleState`.

```dart
class IndoorNavigationWidget extends StatefulWidget with WidgetsBindingObserver {
  // ...

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    WidgetsBinding.instance!.addObserver(this);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    WidgetsBinding.instance!.removeObserver(this);
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    if (state == AppLifecycleState.resumed) {
      // Restore app state here
      restoreLocation().then((location) {
        // Restore indoor map state
        // Restore other relevant widgets' state
      });
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

## Conclusion
Implementing state restoration techniques in your indoor navigation app built with Flutter ensures a robust and user-friendly experience. By persisting the necessary data and leveraging Flutter's state restoration mechanisms, you can easily restore the app's state upon user interaction or device restart. Remember to handle lifecycle events to trigger the restoration process when the app resumes. With these techniques in place, your indoor navigation app will provide a seamless experience for users, allowing them to navigate large buildings with ease.
