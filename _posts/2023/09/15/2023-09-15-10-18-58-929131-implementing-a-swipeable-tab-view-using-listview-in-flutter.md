One of the popular navigation patterns in mobile app development is a swipeable tab view. It allows users to swipe left or right to switch between different tabs or screens within an app. In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement a swipeable tab view using a ListView in Flutter.

### Getting Started

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install Flutter from the official Flutter website: [https://flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev)

### Step 1: Create a new Flutter Project

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Flutter project. Then run the following command to create a new Flutter project:

```flutter
flutter create swipeable_tab_view
```

### Step 2: Add Required Dependencies

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory and open the `pubspec.yaml` file. Add the following dependencies under the `dependencies` section:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.3
  swipeable_tab_view: ^0.1.0
```

Save the changes and run the following command in the project directory to download and install the dependencies:

```flutter
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Implement the Swipeable Tab View

Now, open the `lib/main.dart` file and replace the existing code with the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:swipeable_tab_view/swipeable_tab_view.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Swipeable Tab View',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: SwipeableTabView(
        tabs: [
          Tab(text: 'Tab 1'),
          Tab(text: 'Tab 2'),
          Tab(text: 'Tab 3'),
        ],
        children: [
          ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 20,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'),
              );
            }
          ),
          ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 10,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'),
              );
            }
          ),
          ListView.builder(
            itemCount: 5,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return ListTile(
                title: Text('Item $index'),
              );
            }
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the `SwipeableTabView` widget, we define three tabs and their corresponding children as ListView widgets. You can modify the `itemCount` to change the number of items in each ListView.

### Step 4: Run the App

Save the changes and run the app using the following command:

```flutter
flutter run
```

You should now be able to see a swipeable tab view with three tabs and the corresponding list of items in each tab.

### Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to implement a swipeable tab view using a ListView in Flutter. This navigation pattern provides a user-friendly way to switch between different tabs or screens within an app. By incorporating swipe gestures and ListView widgets, we can create a seamless and interactive user experience.
