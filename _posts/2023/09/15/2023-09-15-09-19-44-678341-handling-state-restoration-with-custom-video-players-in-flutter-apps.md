Video players have become an integral part of mobile applications, allowing users to consume media content efficiently. Flutter, with its cross-platform capabilities, provides a convenient framework for developing video players that work seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

One important aspect of video players is state restoration. State restoration ensures that the playback state of a video is preserved even when the app is paused or closed, allowing users to resume watching from where they left off. In this blog post, we will explore how to handle state restoration with custom video players in Flutter apps.

## 1. Saving and Restoring Playback State

To handle state restoration, we need to save and restore the playback state of the video player. This includes information such as the current position of the video, whether it is playing or paused, and any other relevant metadata.

### Saving State

To save the playback state, we can use the `SharedPreferences` package in Flutter. This package allows us to store key-value pairs persistently on the device. Here's an example of how we can save the playback state:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

class VideoPlayerState {
  // Singleton instance of VideoPlayerState
  static final VideoPlayerState _instance = VideoPlayerState._internal();
  factory VideoPlayerState() => _instance;

  SharedPreferences _prefs;

  // Key used to store playback state
  static const String _prefKey = 'video_player_state';

  bool isPlaying = false;
  Duration currentPosition = Duration.zero;

  VideoPlayerState._internal() {
    _init();
  }

  Future<void> _init() async {
    _prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    _loadState();
  }

  void _loadState() {
    final state = _prefs.getString(_prefKey);
    if (state != null) {
      // Deserialize the saved state
      // Set isPlaying and currentPosition based on the saved state
    }
  }

  void saveState() {
    final state = <String, dynamic>{
      'isPlaying': isPlaying,
      'currentPosition': currentPosition.inMilliseconds,
    };

    // Serialize and store the playback state
    _prefs.setString(_prefKey, jsonEncode(state));
  }
}
```

### Restoring State

When the app is launched or resumed, we need to restore the playback state of the video player. We can do this by retrieving the saved state from `SharedPreferences` and applying it to the video player. Here's an example of how we can restore the playback state:

```dart
class VideoPlayer extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerState createState() => _VideoPlayerState();
}

class _VideoPlayerState extends State<VideoPlayer> {

  VideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = VideoPlayerController.asset('assets/video.mp4')
      ..initialize().then((_) {
        setState(() {
          // Restore playback state after initialization
          final videoPlayerState = VideoPlayerState();
          _controller.seekTo(videoPlayerState.currentPosition);
          if (videoPlayerState.isPlaying) {
            _controller.play();
          }
        });
      });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  // ...
}
```

## 2. Handling App Lifecycles

To ensure that the playback state is saved and restored correctly, we need to handle the lifecycle events of the app.

### Saving State on Pause

When the app is paused or closed, we should save the current playback state. We can achieve this by registering a callback with the `WidgetsBinding` class. Here's an example of how we can save the state on pause:

```dart
class _VideoPlayerState extends State<VideoPlayer> with WidgetsBindingObserver {

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this);
    // ...
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this);
    // ...
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    if (state == AppLifecycleState.paused) {
      final videoPlayerState = VideoPlayerState();
      videoPlayerState.isPlaying = _controller.value.isPlaying;
      videoPlayerState.currentPosition = _controller.value.position;
      videoPlayerState.saveState();
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

### Restoring State on Resume

When the app is resumed, we should restore the playback state using the previously saved state. We can achieve this by listening to the lifecycle events and initializing the video player accordingly. Here's an example of how we can restore the state on resume:

```dart
class _VideoPlayerState extends State<VideoPlayer> with WidgetsBindingObserver {

  // ...

  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    if (state == AppLifecycleState.resumed) {
      setState(() {
        // Restore playback state after resuming
        final videoPlayerState = VideoPlayerState();
        _controller.seekTo(videoPlayerState.currentPosition);
        if (videoPlayerState.isPlaying) {
          _controller.play();
        }
      });
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

## Conclusion

Handling state restoration in custom video players is crucial for providing a seamless user experience in Flutter apps. By saving and restoring the playback state using `SharedPreferences` and handling app lifecycle events, we can ensure that users can resume watching videos effortlessly. Remember to provide a clear and intuitive user interface to indicate the saved playback state and allow users to control their video playback experience effectively.
