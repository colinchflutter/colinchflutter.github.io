Java Development Kits (JDKs) are essential for developing Java applications. However, choosing the right Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is equally important to maximize productivity and efficiency as a developer. In this blog post, we will explore different IDE options and their integration with Java JDK.

## What is an IDE?

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides a comprehensive toolset for software development. It typically includes features like code editing, debugging, build automation, and project management capabilities. Using an IDE can significantly enhance a developer's productivity and streamline the development process.

## Popular IDEs for Java Development

### 1. Eclipse
