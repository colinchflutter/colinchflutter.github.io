Biometric authentication has become increasingly popular for securing sensitive data on mobile devices. Flutter, a cross-platform framework, allows developers to build beautiful and performant applications for multiple platforms using a single codebase. However, when it comes to working with biometric authentication, developers need to write platform-specific code to utilize the native biometric capabilities of each platform.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement biometric authentication in a Flutter app using platform-specific code for both iOS and Android.

## iOS Implementation

To implement biometric authentication on iOS, we can make use of the `LocalAuthentication` framework. This framework provides methods to evaluate and handle biometric authentication requests.

First, add the following permissions to the `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your permission to use Face ID for biometric authentication.</string>
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your permission to use Touch ID for biometric authentication.</string>
```

Next, let's write the code to check if the device supports biometric authentication and authenticate the user using Face ID or Touch ID.

```dart
import 'package:local_auth/local_auth.dart';

// Check if the device supports biometric authentication
Future<bool> isBiometricSupported() async {
  final localAuth = LocalAuthentication();
  return await localAuth.canCheckBiometrics;
}

// Authenticate the user using biometric authentication
Future<bool> authenticate() async {
  final localAuth = LocalAuthentication();
  try {
    return await localAuth.authenticateWithBiometrics(
      localizedReason: 'Authenticate using biometrics',
      useErrorDialogs: true,
      stickyAuth: true,
    );
  } catch (e) {
    print(e);
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Android Implementation

On Android, we can utilize the `biometric` package to work with biometric authentication. This package provides methods to check if the device supports biometric authentication and authenticate the user using fingerprint or face recognition.

First, add the following permissions to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT" />
```

Next, let's write the code to check if the device supports biometric authentication and authenticate the user using fingerprint or face recognition.

```dart
import 'package:biometric/biometric.dart';

// Check if the device supports biometric authentication
Future<bool> isBiometricSupported() async {
  final biometric = Biometric();
  return await biometric.canAuthenticate();
}

// Authenticate the user using biometric authentication
Future<bool> authenticate() async {
  final biometric = Biometric();
  return await biometric.authenticate();
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement biometric authentication in a Flutter app using platform-specific code for both iOS and Android. By utilizing the native biometric capabilities of each platform, developers can provide a seamless and secure authentication experience for their users.

Remember to handle authentication errors and provide fallback options, such as a PIN or password, in case biometric authentication fails or is not supported on the user's device.
