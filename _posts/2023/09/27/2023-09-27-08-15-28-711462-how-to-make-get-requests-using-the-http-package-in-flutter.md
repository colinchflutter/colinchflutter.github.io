In Flutter, we can use the http package to make HTTP requests to servers and retrieve data. The http package provides a convenient way to make GET requests and handle the responses.

To get started, make sure you have imported the http package in your Flutter project:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
```

To make a GET request, we can use the `get()` method from the `http` package. Here's an example:

```dart
void fetchData() async {
  final response = await http.get('https://api.example.com/data');
  
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // Request successful, parse the response
    final responseData = response.body;
    // Do something with the data...
  } else {
    // Request failed, handle the error
    print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}');
  }
}
```

In this example, we are making a GET request to `https://api.example.com/data`. The `get()` method returns a `Future` that resolves to a `Response` object. We await the response and check the `statusCode` to determine if the request was successful.

Inside the `if (response.statusCode == 200)` block, you can parse the response body and handle the data as needed. In this example, we simply store the response body in the `responseData` variable.

If the request fails for any reason, you can handle the error inside the `else` block. Here, we print the status code of the failed request.

Remember to add the necessary permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` and `Info.plist` files to allow network requests.

By using the http package in Flutter, you can easily make GET requests to retrieve data from servers. Make sure to handle both successful responses and error cases appropriately in your code. Happy coding! #Flutter #HTTP
