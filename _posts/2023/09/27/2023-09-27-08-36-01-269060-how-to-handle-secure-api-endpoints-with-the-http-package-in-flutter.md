In many Flutter applications, you'll need to make API calls to fetch data from a server. It is important to ensure that the API endpoints you are calling are secure and protected. In this article, we will discuss how to handle secure API endpoints using the `http` package in Flutter.

## Step 1: Import the `http` package

First, you need to import the `http` package in your Flutter project. Open your project's `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `http` package dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: ^0.13.0
```

Save the file and run `flutter pub get` to fetch and install the package.

## Step 2: Make secure API requests

To make secure API requests, you need to pass the necessary security parameters in the request headers. Here's an example of how to make a secure GET request:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void fetchData() async {
  final url = Uri.https('api.example.com', '/data');
  
  final response = await http.get(
    url,
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // API call successful
    final data = response.body;
    // Process the data
  } else {
    // Error handling
    final errorMessage = response.reasonPhrase;
    // Handle the error
  }
}
```

In this example, we are making a GET request to `https://api.example.com/data` and passing the authorization token in the request header. Remember to replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with the actual authentication token.

Similarly, you can make other types of requests like POST, PUT, or DELETE by using the respective methods provided by the `http` package.

## Step 3: Error handling and data processing

After making the API request, you need to handle any errors that might occur during the process. In the code snippet above, we're checking the status code of the response to determine if the API call was successful. If the status code is 200, we can process the data returned by the API. Otherwise, we can handle the error by accessing the `response.reasonPhrase` property.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can handle secure API endpoints in your Flutter application using the `http` package. Remember to properly authenticate your requests by passing the authorization token in the request headers and handle any errors that may occur during the API call.
