In some cases, you may need to configure proxies for sending HTTP requests in your Flutter application. Proxies are used to route network traffic through a middleman server, which can be useful for various purposes such as logging, caching, or bypassing network restrictions.

To configure proxies for HTTP requests in Flutter, we can make use of the `http` package along with a custom `Client` class. Here's how you can do it:

## Import the necessary packages
```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:http/io_client.dart' as http_proxy;
```

## Create a custom proxy-aware client
```dart
class ProxyAwareClient extends http.BaseClient {
  final http_proxy.IOClient _client;

  ProxyAwareClient(this._client);

  Future<http.StreamedResponse> send(http.BaseRequest request) {
      // Set the proxy configuration
      _client.findProxy = (url) => 'PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT';

      // Set any desired headers or modifications to the request
      // before sending it through the proxy server

      return _client.send(request);
  }
}
```

## Use the custom client for HTTP requests
```dart
void main() async {
  final proxyClient = ProxyAwareClient(http_proxy.IOClient());

  // Make HTTP request using the proxy client
  final response = await proxyClient.get('https://api.example.com/data');

  print(response.body);
}
```

In the example above, we create a custom `ProxyAwareClient` class that extends `http.BaseClient`. Inside the `send` method, we set the proxy configuration using the `findProxy` method of the `IOClient`. You need to replace `'PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT'` with the actual IP address and port of your proxy server.

Once the custom client is set up, you can use it to make HTTP requests just like you would with the regular `http` package. In the example above, we make a GET request to `https://api.example.com/data` using the proxy client.

Remember to replace the placeholder `https://api.example.com/data` with the actual URL you want to request from.

That's it! Now you should be able to send HTTP requests through a proxy server in your Flutter application using the `http` package. Be sure to handle any errors that may occur during the request. Happy coding!
