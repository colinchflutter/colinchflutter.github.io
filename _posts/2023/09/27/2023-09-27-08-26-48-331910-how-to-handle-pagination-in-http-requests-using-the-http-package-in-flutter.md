When working with APIs that return large amounts of data, it's common to implement pagination to retrieve data in smaller chunks. In Flutter, you can handle pagination in HTTP requests using the `http` package. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement pagination in your app using the `http` package.

## 1. Make an initial HTTP request

To start pagination, you need to make an initial HTTP request to the API endpoint. This will typically return a limited number of results along with pagination metadata such as `totalItems`, `perPage`, and a `nextPage` token.

Here's an example of making an initial HTTP request using the `http` package in Flutter:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

final url = Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/items?page=1');

final response = await http.get(url);
if (response.statusCode == 200) {
  // Parse the response and extract the necessary data
  // Store the retrieved data in your app's state or display it
} else {
  // Handle error response
}
```

## 2. Extract pagination metadata

After receiving the response, extract the pagination metadata from the API response. Typically, you will find information such as `totalItems`, `currentPage`, and `nextPage` in the response.

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

final responseData = json.decode(response.body);

final totalItems = responseData['totalItems'];
final perPage = responseData['perPage'];
final nextPage = responseData['nextPage'];
```

## 3. Making subsequent requests for pagination

To retrieve the next page or subsequent pages of data, you need to use the `nextPage` token obtained from the initial response. This token serves as a parameter in the URL for the subsequent requests.

```dart
final nextPageUrl = Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/items?page=$nextPage');

final nextPageResponse = await http.get(nextPageUrl);
if (nextPageResponse.statusCode == 200) {
  // Parse the response and extract the necessary data
  // Store the retrieved data in your app's state or display it
} else {
  // Handle error response
}
```

## 4. Handling error cases

In case of an error response, it's important to handle the error appropriately. You can display an error message to the user or implement retry logic if needed.

```dart
if (response.statusCode == 200) {
  // Handle successful response
} else {
  // Handle error response
}
```

## Conclusion

Implementing pagination in your Flutter app using the `http` package is crucial when dealing with large datasets. By making initial requests, extracting pagination metadata, and making subsequent requests, you can efficiently retrieve and display data to users in a paginated manner.

Remember to handle error cases and provide appropriate feedback to users. With the `http` package in Flutter, handling pagination in HTTP requests becomes simple and efficient.
