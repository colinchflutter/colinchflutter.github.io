In Flutter, the `http` package allows us to make HTTP requests to external APIs and handle the response. Along with the response body, HTTP responses also contain headers that provide additional information about the data being sent.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to handle the response headers in Flutter using the `http` package.

## Prerequisites
Before we get started, make sure you have the `http` package included in your `pubspec.yaml` file. You can add it as follows:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: ^0.13.3
```

After adding the package, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the latest dependencies.

## Making an HTTP Request with the http Package
To make an HTTP request with the `http` package, we use the `get()` function. Here's an example that makes a GET request to an API and retrieves the response headers:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void fetchData() async {
  var url = Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/data');
  var response = await http.get(url);

  print('Status Code: ${response.statusCode}');
  print('Response Headers: ${response.headers}');
  print('Response Body: ${response.body}');
}
```

In the above code, we use the `await` keyword to wait for the HTTP request to complete. The response object contains the headers as a `Map<String, String>` that we can access using the `headers` property.

## Accessing Specific Response Headers
If we want to access specific response headers, we can use the `headers` property and provide the desired header key. For example:

```dart
print('Content-Type: ${response.headers['content-type']}');
print('Server: ${response.headers['server']}');
```

By specifying the header key, we can extract the corresponding value from the headers map.

## Summary
In this tutorial, we have learned how to handle response headers in Flutter using the `http` package. We can access the response headers through the `headers` property of the `http.Response` object. This functionality enables us to extract specific information from the response headers and use it as needed in our Flutter applications.
