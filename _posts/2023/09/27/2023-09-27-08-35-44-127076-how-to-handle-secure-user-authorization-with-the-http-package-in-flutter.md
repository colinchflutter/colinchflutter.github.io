User authorization is a critical aspect of any application, especially when it involves transmitting user credentials securely over the network. In Flutter, you can use the `http` package to handle HTTP requests and implement secure user authorization. This blog post will guide you through the process step by step.

## Step 1: Import the necessary packages and define variables

Before starting, make sure you have added the `http` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file and imported it in your Dart file. You will also need to import the `dart:convert` package to handle JSON encoding and decoding.

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'dart:convert';

final baseUrl = 'https://api.example.com';
final loginPath = '/login';
final userPath = '/user';
```

## Step 2: Send a login request to obtain an authentication token

To implement secure user authorization, you typically need to obtain an authentication token from the server. This token will be used for subsequent requests to authenticate the user. 

```dart
Future<String> login(String username, String password) async {
  final url = '$baseUrl$loginPath';
  
  try {
    final response = await http.post(
      Uri.parse(url),
      body: {
        'username': username,
        'password': password,
      },
    );

    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      final userDetails = json.decode(response.body);
      return userDetails['token'];
    } else {
      throw Exception('Failed to log in');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    throw Exception('Failed to connect to the server');
  }
}
```

In this example, we send a `POST` request to the server with the user's credentials. If the response status code is `200`, we parse the response body to obtain the authentication token. Otherwise, we throw an exception indicating a failed login attempt.

## Step 3: Add the authentication token to subsequent requests

Once we have obtained the authentication token, we need to include it in subsequent requests to authenticate the user. One way to do this is by adding an `Authorization` header to the request.

```dart
Future<http.Response> getUserDetails(String authToken) async {
  final url = '$baseUrl$userPath';

  try {
    final response = await http.get(
      Uri.parse(url),
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer $authToken',
      },
    );

    return response;
  } catch (e) {
    throw Exception('Failed to connect to the server');
  }
}
```

In this example, we send a `GET` request to retrieve user details. We include the authentication token in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can handle secure user authorization using the `http` package in Flutter. Remember to handle exceptions and errors appropriately to provide a seamless user experience. Using secure authorization methods helps protect sensitive user data and ensures the integrity of your app's communication with the server.
