1. Open your Flutter project in an IDE or code editor of your choice.
2. In your project's `pubspec.yaml` file, under the `dependencies` section, add the following line:

  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    http: ^0.13.0
  ```

   This will add the `http` package as a dependency to your project.

3. Save the `pubspec.yaml` file and run the following command in the terminal to fetch and update the package:

   ```shell
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Once the package installation is complete, you can import the `http` package in your Dart file as follows:

   ```dart
   import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
   ```

   The `http` package provides various methods to make HTTP requests, such as `http.get()`, `http.post()`, etc. You can now use these methods to interact with APIs and fetch data in your Flutter app.

Remember to import the package in the correct file or module where you intend to use it.
