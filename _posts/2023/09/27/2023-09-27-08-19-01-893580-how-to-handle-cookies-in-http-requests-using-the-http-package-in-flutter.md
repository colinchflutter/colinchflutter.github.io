Cookies play a vital role in web development when it comes to maintaining session and persistent data on the client-side. When working with Flutter, you can easily handle cookies in HTTP requests using the `http` package. In this tutorial, we will explore how to handle cookies in HTTP requests with Flutter.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the `http` package added to your Flutter project. You can add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.3
```

After adding the package, run `flutter pub get` to install it.

## Sending HTTP Requests with Cookies

To send an HTTP request with cookies, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the `http.Client` class.

  ```dart
  import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

  final client = http.Client();
  ```

2. Create a `CookieJar` instance to manage the cookies.

  ```dart
  final cookieJar = http.CookieJar();
  ```

3. Attach the `cookieJar` to the client using the `cookieJar` parameter.

  ```dart
  final client = http.Client(cookieJar: cookieJar);
  ```

4. Send an HTTP request with cookies.

  ```dart
  final response = await client.get(
    Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/data'),
    headers: {'Accept': 'application/json'},
  );
  ```

## Receiving and Storing Cookies

To receive and store cookies received in the HTTP responses:

1. Make sure you have a reference to the `cookieJar` instance.

2. Extract the cookies from the response headers using the `Set-Cookie` header.

  ```dart
  final headers = response.headers;
  final cookies = headers['set-cookie'];
  ```

3. Store the cookies in the `cookieJar`:

  ```dart
  cookieJar.saveFromResponse(
    response.request!.url,
    cookies!.split(';')[0],
  );
  ```

## Retrieving Cookies for Subsequent Requests

When making subsequent HTTP requests, you can retrieve the stored cookies from the `cookieJar` and attach them to your request headers.

```dart
final request = http.Request('GET', Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/protected'));
final cookies = cookieJar.loadForRequest(request.url);
final cookieHeader = cookies.map((c) => '${c.name}=${c.value}').join('; ');

request.headers['cookie'] = cookieHeader;

final response = await client.send(request);
```

That's it! You have successfully learned how to handle cookies in HTTP requests using the `http` package in Flutter.
