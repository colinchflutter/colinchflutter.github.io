The `http` package in Flutter provides an easy way to make HTTP requests. It supports various types of requests, including multipart requests. Multipart requests are commonly used when uploading files or sending data that contains both text and binary content.

In order to send a multipart request using the `http` package, you need to follow these steps:

1. Import the `http` package:
```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
```

2. Create a `http.MultipartRequest` object:
```dart
final request = http.MultipartRequest('POST', Uri.parse('your_request_url'));
```
Note that you need to specify the HTTP method (in this case, `POST`) and the URL that you want to send the request to.

3. Add any text or binary data to the request:
```dart
request.fields['text_field_name'] = 'Text field value';
request.files.add(await http.MultipartFile.fromPath(
  'binary_field_name',
  'path/to/file',
));
```
In the above example, we add a text field named `text_field_name` and set its value to `'Text field value'`. We also add a binary field named `binary_field_name` and attach a file from the local file system.

4. Send the multipart request and retrieve the response:
```dart
final response = await request.send();
final responseString = await response.stream.transform(utf8.decoder).join();
```
The `send()` method sends the request and returns a `http.StreamedResponse`. You can then read the response using the `stream` property and transform it into a string using `utf8.decoder`.

**Note**: Don't forget to handle exceptions and errors that might occur during the process.

That's it! You have successfully sent a multipart request using the `http` package in Flutter. Remember to modify the field names, values, and URL according to your specific use case.
