## Introduction

In mobile app development, handling JSON data is crucial. It allows us to exchange data between the client and server, and convert complex objects into a format that can be easily stored and transmitted. In Flutter, the sqflite_bloc package provides a convenient way to serialize and deserialize JSON data when working with databases. In this blog post, we will explore how to use sqflite_bloc to handle JSON data in Flutter.

## Step 1: Installing the sqflite_bloc Package

To begin, let's install the sqflite_bloc package in our Flutter project. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Flutter project. Then, run the following command:

```
flutter pub add sqflite_bloc
```

This will add the sqflite_bloc package to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file and download it.

## Step 2: Creating the Model Class

The first step in serializing and deserializing JSON data is to create a model class that represents the structure of the JSON data. Let's say we have a JSON object representing a user with the following structure:

```dart
{
   "id": 1,
   "name": "John Doe",
   "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

We can create a model class called `User` to represent this JSON structure. Here's an example of how the `User` class would look like:

```dart
class User {
  final int id;
  final String name;
  final String email;

  User({required this.id, required this.name, required this.email});

  factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return User(
      id: json['id'],
      name: json['name'],
      email: json['email'],
    );
  }

  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() {
    return {
      'id': id,
      'name': name,
      'email': email,
    };
  }
}
```
