When working with API requests in Flutter, it's common to come across endpoints that require Basic Authentication. Basic Authentication is a simple method for sending a username and password with each request. In this blog post, we'll explore how to handle Basic Authentication using the `http` package in Flutter.

## Setting up the HTTP Package

To get started, you need to add the `http` package to your Flutter project. Open your project's `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under the dependencies section:

```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.3
```

After adding the package, run `flutter pub get` to download and update the project dependencies.

## Performing Basic Authentication

To perform Basic Authentication with the `http` package, you need to set the `Authorization` header of the request. The header value must be the word "Basic" followed by a base64-encoded string of the username and password.

Here's an example of how to handle Basic Authentication using the `http` package in Flutter:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'dart:convert';

Future<void> fetchData() async {
  final username = 'your_username';
  final password = 'your_password';
  final url = 'https://api.example.com/endpoint';

  final basicAuth = 'Basic ' + base64Encode(utf8.encode('$username:$password'));

  final response = await http.get(
    Uri.parse(url),
    headers: {'Authorization': basicAuth},
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // Success! Process the response data here
  } else {
    // Error handling
  }
}
```

In the code above, we first define the username and password. Then, we construct the basicAuth string by encoding the username and password using base64 and prepending it with the word "Basic". Next, we make a GET request to a specific URL with the headers containing the `Authorization` header.

Remember to replace `'your_username'`, `'your_password'`, and `'https://api.example.com/endpoint'` with your actual values.

## Conclusion

Handling Basic Authentication using the `http` package in Flutter is quite straightforward. By setting the `Authorization` header with the appropriate value, you can authenticate requests to protected endpoints. Make sure to securely store and handle your username and password to prevent unauthorized access to your API.
