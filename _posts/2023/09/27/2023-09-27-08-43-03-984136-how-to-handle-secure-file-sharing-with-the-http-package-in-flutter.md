When developing a Flutter app, it is often necessary to share files securely with a server using the HTTP protocol. In this blog post, we will explore how to handle secure file sharing using the `http` package in Flutter.

## Installation

To get started, add the `http` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.2
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to download the package into your project.

## Sending Files

To send a file to the server securely, you need to use the `MultipartRequest` class provided by the `http` package. This class allows you to send files as part of an HTTP request with multipart/form-data encoding.

Here's an example of how to send a file using the `MultipartRequest` class:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:http_parser/http_parser.dart' show MediaType;

Future<void> uploadFile(String filepath) async {
  var request = http.MultipartRequest('POST', Uri.parse('https://example.com/upload'));
  
  // Add the file to the request
  request.files.add(await http.MultipartFile.fromPath('file', filepath,
      contentType: MediaType('application', 'octet-stream')));
  
  // Send the request and get the response
  var response = await request.send();
  
  // Check the response status code
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    print('File uploaded successfully');
  } else {
    print('Error uploading file: ${response.reasonPhrase}');
  }
}
```

In the above code, we create a `MultipartRequest` object with the HTTP method (POST) and the URL of the server endpoint. We then add the file to the request using the `MultipartFile.fromPath()` method. 

Make sure to replace `'https://example.com/upload'` with the actual URL of your server endpoint.

## Receiving Files

On the server side, you need to handle the incoming request and save the uploaded file to a secure location. The specifics of this process depend on your server-side technology stack.

In Flutter, you can use the `http` package to download and save files from the server. Here's an example of how to download a file using the `http` package:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'dart:io';

Future<void> downloadFile(String url, String savePath) async {
  var response = await http.get(Uri.parse(url));
  
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    File file = File(savePath);
    await file.writeAsBytes(response.bodyBytes);
    print('File downloaded and saved');
  } else {
    print('Error downloading file: ${response.reasonPhrase}');
  }
}
```

In the above code, we use the `http.get()` method to send an HTTP GET request to the server endpoint. We then check the response status code to ensure a successful download. Finally, we use the `File` class from `dart:io` to write the downloaded file to the specified `savePath`.

Remember to replace `'https://example.com/file.txt'` with the actual URL of the file you want to download, and `'path/to/save/file.txt'` with the desired save path on the device.

## Conclusion

Handling secure file sharing with the `http` package in Flutter is essential for many app development scenarios. By using the `MultipartRequest` class, you can easily send files to a server, and by using the `http.get()` method, you can download files securely. With these tools at your disposal, you can enhance the functionality of your Flutter app and provide a seamless file sharing experience.
