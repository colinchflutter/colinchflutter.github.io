In a Flutter application, handling secure user login is crucial to protect user data and maintain the integrity of the application. The `http` package in Flutter provides a convenient way to make HTTP requests and handle responses. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the `http` package to handle secure user login.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the `http` package added to your Flutter project. You can add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.4
```

## Steps to Handle Secure User Login

### 1. Import the `http` package

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
```

### 2. Create a method to handle user login

```dart
Future<void> handleLogin(String username, String password) async {
  // Construct the login request URL
  final url = Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/login');

  // Create a Map to hold the login data
  final loginData = {
    'username': username,
    'password': password,
  };

  try {
    // Make a POST request to the login API
    final response = await http.post(
      url,
      body: loginData,
    );

    // Check if the login was successful
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      // Handle successful login
      print('Login successful');
    } else {
      // Handle failed login
      print('Login failed');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle any errors that occurred during the login process
    print('Error occurred: $e');
  }
}
```

### 3. Implement the user login

```dart
// Inside your login button's onPressed callback
void login() {
  final username = 'example';
  final password = 'password';

  handleLogin(username, password);
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to handle secure user login using the `http` package in Flutter. The `http` package allows you to easily make HTTP requests and handle responses, making it a convenient choice for handling user authentication. Remember to handle errors and provide appropriate feedback to the user based on the login response.
