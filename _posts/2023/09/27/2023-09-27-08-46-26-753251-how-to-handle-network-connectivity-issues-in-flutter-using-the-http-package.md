Handling network connectivity issues is crucial in any Flutter application that relies on making HTTP requests. In this blog post, we'll explore how to handle and gracefully recover from network connectivity issues using the `http` package.

## Checking Network Connectivity

Before making any HTTP requests, it's essential to check the network connectivity status of the device. To do this, we can use the connectivity package, which provides a cross-platform solution for monitoring network connectivity.

First, add the `connectivity` package to your pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  connectivity: ^2.0.2
```

After adding the package, run `flutter pub get` to install it.

## Handling Connectivity Changes

To handle changes in network connectivity, we can use the `Connectivity` class from the `connectivity` package. We can use the `connectionStatus` stream to listen for changes in network connectivity.

Here's an example of how to check the connectivity status:

```dart
import 'package:connectivity/connectivity.dart';

Future<void> checkConnectivity() async {
  var connectivityResult = await Connectivity().checkConnectivity();
  if (connectivityResult == ConnectivityResult.none) {
    // Handle case when there is no available network connection
    print('No network connection available');
  } else {
    // Handle case when network connection is available
    print('Network connection available');
  }
}

```

## Handling HTTP Requests with Connectivity Handling

Sometimes, a network connectivity issue might occur while performing an HTTP request. To handle this scenario, we can wrap our HTTP requests inside a try-catch block and check for connectivity issues.

Here's an example of how to handle network connectivity issues when making an HTTP request using the `http` package:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:connectivity/connectivity.dart';

Future<void> fetchData() async {
  try {
    var connectivityResult = await Connectivity().checkConnectivity();
    if (connectivityResult == ConnectivityResult.none) {
      throw Exception('No network connection available');
    } else {
      var response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/data'));
      // Handle the response
    }
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle network connectivity errors
    print('Error: $e');
  }
}
```

By using this approach, we can catch any network connectivity errors and handle them appropriately to provide better user experience in our Flutter application.

## Conclusion

Handling network connectivity issues is crucial in any Flutter application that relies on making HTTP requests. By using the `connectivity` package to check network connectivity status and wrapping HTTP requests in a try-catch block, we can gracefully handle and recover from network connectivity issues.

Remember to import the necessary packages (`connectivity` and `http`) and make use of asynchronous functions to handle network requests.
