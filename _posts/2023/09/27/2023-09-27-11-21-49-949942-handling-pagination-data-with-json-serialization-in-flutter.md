In many mobile applications, you may need to handle pagination when working with APIs that return large sets of data. Pagination allows you to retrieve data in chunks instead of loading everything at once, improving performance and reducing memory usage.

In this article, we'll explore how to handle pagination data with JSON serialization in Flutter, a popular cross-platform mobile app development framework.

## Understanding Pagination

Pagination involves breaking down a large set of data into smaller chunks called pages. When requesting data, instead of retrieving the entire dataset, you retrieve a specific number of items per page.

Typically, the API response contains metadata that includes the total number of items available, the current page, and the number of items per page. By using this information, you can implement pagination logic in your Flutter app.

## JSON Serialization

Flutter provides powerful tools for handling JSON serialization, allowing you to convert JSON data to Dart objects and vice versa.

To get started, you'll need to add the `json_serializable` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. This package leverages code generation to create the necessary serialization code based on annotations.

Here's an example of how to use the `json_serializable` package to deserialize a JSON response into a list of objects:

```dart
import 'package:json_annotation/json_annotation.dart';

part 'my_object.g.dart';

@JsonSerializable()
class MyObject {
  final String name;
  final int age;

  MyObject(this.name, this.age);

  factory MyObject.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$MyObjectFromJson(json);

  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => _$MyObjectToJson(this);
}
```

In the example above, we define a `MyObject` class that represents the structure of the JSON data. The `@JsonSerializable` annotation tells the code generator to create the necessary serialization and deserialization code.

To generate the corresponding serialization code, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This command generates the `my_object.g.dart` file, which contains the implementation of the `fromJson` and `toJson` methods.

## Handling Pagination Data

When dealing with pagination, you'll typically make multiple API requests to retrieve data for each page. You need to keep track of the current page, update it after each request, and append the results to the existing data.

Here's an example of how you can handle pagination data using the `http` package and JSON serialization in Flutter:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<dynamic> fetchData(int page) async {
  const String apiUrl = 'https://api.example.com/data?page=';

  final response = await http.get(Uri.parse(apiUrl + page.toString()));
  final jsonResponse = jsonDecode(response.body);

  return jsonResponse.map((item) => MyObject.fromJson(item)).toList();
}

List<MyObject> mergedList = [];
int currentPage = 1;

void loadData() async {
  final data = await fetchData(currentPage);

  setState(() {
    mergedList.addAll(data);
    currentPage++;
  });
}
```

In this example, the `fetchData` function fetches a specific page of data using the `http` package. The JSON response is then deserialized into a list of `MyObject` objects using the generated serialization code.

The `loadData` function is responsible for loading and merging the data into the `mergedList`. It updates the `currentPage` variable after each request to retrieve the next page.

## Conclusion

Handling pagination data with JSON serialization in Flutter allows you to efficiently manage large datasets in your mobile applications. By breaking down data into smaller chunks, you can improve performance and provide a better user experience.

Remember to leverage Flutter's JSON serialization capabilities by using the `json_serializable` package to easily convert JSON data into Dart objects. With proper pagination logic in place, you can handle large data sets with ease.
