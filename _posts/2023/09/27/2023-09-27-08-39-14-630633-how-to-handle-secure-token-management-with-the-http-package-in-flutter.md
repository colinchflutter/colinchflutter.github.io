In mobile app development, handling secure token management is crucial to ensure the security of user data and protect against unauthorized access. In Flutter, the `http` package provides an easy way to make HTTP requests and handle secure token management. By following a few best practices, you can effectively manage secure tokens in your Flutter app.

## 1. Retrieving the Token

Before making any HTTP requests, you need to retrieve the token from a secure storage, such as `SharedPreferences` or a secure key store. Let's assume you have a function called `getToken` that retrieves the token asynchronously. Here's an example of how you can retrieve the token using `SharedPreferences`:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

Future<String> getToken() async {
  SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  String token = prefs.getString('token') ?? ''; // Default value if token is not found
  return token;
}
```

## 2. Adding the Token to the Request Headers

Once you have retrieved the token, you can add it to the headers of your HTTP request. The `http` package provides the `headers` parameter to set custom headers for your request. Add the token to the headers using the `Authorization` header, specifying the type of authentication (e.g., Bearer).

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

String url = 'https://api.example.com/users';
String token = await getToken();

http.Response response = await http.get(
  Uri.parse(url),
  headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer $token'},
);
```

## 3. Handling Token Expiration and Renewal

Secure tokens have an expiration date and, if expired, the user needs to authenticate again to obtain a new one. To handle token expiration, you can add authentication middleware that intercepts the HTTP response. If the response returns a 401 unauthorized status code, you can prompt the user to login again and obtain a new token.

```dart
http.Response response = await http.get(
  Uri.parse(url),
  headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer $token'},
);

if (response.statusCode == 401) {
  // Handle token expiration
  await showLoginScreen();
  String newToken = await getToken();
  // Retry the request with the new token
  response = await http.get(
    Uri.parse(url),
    headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer $newToken'},
  );
}
```

By implementing this logic, you can effectively handle secure token management and ensure that your app securely communicates with the server.

Remember to store the token securely and follow best practices for token expiration and renewal to enhance the security of your app.
