## Introduction
HTTP interceptors are a powerful feature that allows you to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses in your Flutter application. This can be useful for various scenarios like adding headers, handling authentication, or logging network traffic. In this blog post, we will see how to use HTTP interceptors with the `http` package in Flutter.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have Flutter and the `http` package installed in your Flutter development environment.

## Setting up the HTTP Interceptor
To use HTTP interceptors, we need to create a custom `HttpOverrides` class that extends the default `HttpOverrides` class provided by Flutter. This custom class will override the `createHttpClient` method to return an `HttpClient` instance with our interceptor.

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

class CustomHttpOverrides extends http.BaseClient {
  @override
  Future<http.StreamedResponse> send(http.BaseRequest request) {
    // Perform interception logic here
    // Modify the request headers or perform any other operations

    // Call the original send method to proceed with the request
    return super.send(request);
  }
}

void main() {
  http.Client = CustomHttpOverrides();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

```

In the code above, we create a custom `HttpOverrides` class named `CustomHttpOverrides`. We override the `send` method to add our interception logic. Inside this method, you can modify the request headers or perform any other operations before calling the original `send` method.

To use our custom `HttpOverrides`, we assign an instance of it to the `Http` class in the `main` function.

## Testing the Interceptor
Now that we have set up the HTTP interceptor, let's test it by making a sample HTTP request.

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void fetchData() async {
  var url = 'https://api.example.com/data';
  var response = await http.get(url);
  
  // Process the response data
  print(response.body);
}

void main() {
  fetchData();
}
```

In the code above, we have a `fetchData` function that makes a GET request to a sample API endpoint. The `http.get` method will now use our custom `HttpClient` with the interceptor.

## Conclusion
HTTP interceptors provide a flexible way to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses in your Flutter application. In this blog post, we learned how to set up HTTP interceptors using the `http` package and make requests with them.

By using HTTP interceptors, you can easily add functionality like modifying headers, handling authentication, or logging network traffic, thereby enhancing the functionality and security of your Flutter app.
