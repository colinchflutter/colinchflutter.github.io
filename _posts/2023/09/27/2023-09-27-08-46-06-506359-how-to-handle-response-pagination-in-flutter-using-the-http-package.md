Pagination is a common requirement when working with APIs that return a large number of results. In Flutter, you can use the `http` package to make HTTP requests and handle pagination in a simple and intuitive way. 

In this blog post, we will guide you through the process of handling response pagination in Flutter using the `http` package.

## Step 1: Making the Initial API Request

To get started, import the `http` package in your Flutter project by adding the following line of code to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```
dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.3
```

Once the package is imported, make an initial API request to fetch the first page of results. For example:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void fetchInitialPage() async {
  var url = Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/results');

  var response = await http.get(url);

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // Process the response data
    print(response.body);
  } else {
    // Handle error
    print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}');
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Parsing the Response and Handling Pagination

After making the initial API request, you need to parse the response and extract information about the pagination. This typically involves checking if there are more pages available and extracting the necessary parameters for the next page request.

```dart
void parseResponseAndHandlePagination(String responseBody) {
  // Parse the response data
  var data = json.decode(responseBody);
  
  // Extract information about pagination
  bool hasNextPage = data['has_next_page'];
  int nextPageNumber = data['next_page_number'];
  
  // Handle pagination
  if (hasNextPage) {
    // Make the next page request
    makeNextPageRequest(nextPageNumber);
  } else {
    // No more pages, stop pagination
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Making Subsequent Page Requests

To fetch subsequent pages, you need to make additional API requests using the pagination parameters obtained from the previous response.

```dart
void makeNextPageRequest(int nextPageNumber) async {
  var url = Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/results?page=$nextPageNumber');

  var response = await http.get(url);

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // Process the response data
    parseResponseAndHandlePagination(response.body);
  } else {
    // Handle error
    print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}');
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can successfully handle response pagination in Flutter using the `http` package. Remember to check if there are more pages available, extract the necessary parameters, and make subsequent page requests accordingly.

Using pagination allows you to efficiently fetch large sets of data from APIs and display them to users in a more manageable way.
