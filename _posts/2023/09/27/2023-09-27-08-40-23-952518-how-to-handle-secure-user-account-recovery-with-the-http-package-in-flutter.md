With the increasing demand for secure user account recovery in mobile applications, it is essential to implement secure and reliable account recovery mechanisms. In this tutorial, we will explore how to handle secure user account recovery using the `http` package in Flutter.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Flutter and Dart programming language.
- `http` package added as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

## Step 1: Setting Up the API Endpoint

First, let's set up an API endpoint that handles account recovery requests. Ensure that the endpoint is secure and requires authentication for account recovery actions. 

## Step 2: Creating a Service Class

Next, create a service class to encapsulate the API calls related to user account recovery. Start by creating a new Dart file, e.g., `account_recovery_service.dart`, and define a class with relevant methods for account recovery.

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

class AccountRecoveryService {
  final String _baseUrl = 'https://api.example.com';

 Future<void> sendAccountRecoveryEmail(String email) async {
    final url = Uri.parse('$_baseUrl/account/recovery');
    
    final response = await http.post(
      url,
      body: {'email': email},
    );

    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      // Successful recovery email sent
    } else {
      throw Exception('Failed to send recovery email');
    }
  }

  Future<void> resetPassword(String token, String newPassword) async {
    final url = Uri.parse('$_baseUrl/account/reset-password');
    
    final response = await http.post(
      url,
      body: {
        'token': token,
        'new_password': newPassword,
      },
    );

    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      // Password reset successful
    } else {
      throw Exception('Failed to reset password');
    }
  }
}
```

In the above example, we define two methods: `sendAccountRecoveryEmail` to send a recovery email to the specified email address and `resetPassword` to reset the user's password using a recovery token and a new password.

## Step 3: Implementing User Interface

Add a button in your user interface to initiate the account recovery process. On button press, call the `sendAccountRecoveryEmail` method to send the recovery email. Once the user receives the email and clicks on the recovery link, navigate the user to a password reset screen.

On the password reset screen, provide fields to enter the recovery token and set a new password. On form submission, call the `resetPassword` method to reset the password.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to handle secure user account recovery using the `http` package in Flutter. By following these steps, you can implement a secure and reliable account recovery mechanism in your Flutter applications. Remember to always consider the best practices for account security to protect your users' data.
