![flutter_socket_io](https://example.com/flutter_socket_io.png)

If you're building a Flutter app that needs to communicate with a server using **socket.io**, the `flutter_socket_io` package can be a lifesaver. It provides easy-to-use methods for sending and receiving JSON data over socket.io connections.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to serialize and deserialize JSON data using `flutter_socket_io` in Flutter.

## Installing `flutter_socket_io`

Start by adding `flutter_socket_io` to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_socket_io: ^0.6.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

## Serializing JSON

Serializing JSON data allows you to convert your Dart objects into JSON format so that they can be sent over the socket connection. To do this, you can use the `jsonEncode` method provided by the `dart:convert` package.

Here's an example of how to serialize a Dart object into JSON:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

Map<String, dynamic> user = {
  'name': 'John Doe',
  'age': 25,
};

String userJson = jsonEncode(user);
```

Now, you can send `userJson` over the socket connection using `flutter_socket_io`.

## Deserializing JSON

On the receiving end, you'll need to deserialize the received JSON data back into Dart objects. Again, you can use the `jsonDecode` method provided by the `dart:convert` package.

Here's an example of how to deserialize JSON into a Dart object:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

String messageJson = '{"text": "Hello from the server!"}';

Map<String, dynamic> message = jsonDecode(messageJson);
String receivedText = message['text'];
```

Now, you can process the received JSON data using Dart objects.

## Putting it all together

Here's an example of how to use `flutter_socket_io` to send and receive JSON data:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:flutter_socket_io/flutter_socket_io.dart';
import 'package:flutter_socket_io/socket_io_manager.dart';

SocketIO socketIO;

void main() {
  socketIO = SocketIOManager().createSocketIO(
    'https://example.com',
    '/',
  );

  socketIO.init();

  socketIO.subscribe('message', (jsonData) {
    String receivedJson = jsonData.toString();
    Map<String, dynamic> message = jsonDecode(receivedJson);
    String receivedText = message['text'];
    
    // Do something with the received JSON data
  });

  socketIO.sendMessage('message', jsonEncode({'text': 'Hello server!'}));
}
```

Make sure to replace `"https://example.com"` with the URL of your socket.io server.

And that's all there is to it! You can now serialize and deserialize JSON data using `flutter_socket_io` in your Flutter app. Happy coding!
