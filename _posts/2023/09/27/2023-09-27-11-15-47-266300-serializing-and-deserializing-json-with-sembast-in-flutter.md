In mobile app development, the ability to serialize and deserialize data is crucial for handling JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Flutter provides a powerful database package called Sembast, which not only offers efficient data storage but also allows us to easily convert JSON to objects and vice versa. In this blog post, we will explore how to serialize and deserialize JSON data using Sembast in Flutter.

## What is Sembast?

Sembast is a NoSQL embedded persistent storage engine for Flutter. It provides a simple and intuitive API to store, query, and retrieve data. Sembast stores data in key-value format and supports multiple data types, including JSON.

## Serializing JSON with Sembast

To serialize JSON data with Sembast, we need to convert the data into a format that can be stored in the database. Flutter provides the `dart:convert` library, which offers JSON serialization and deserialization functions.

Here's an example of serializing a JSON object using Sembast:

```dart
import 'package:sembast/sembast.dart';
import 'package:sembast/json.dart' as jsonConverter;

void serializeJson(Database database, Map<String, dynamic> json) async {
  var store = intMapStoreFactory.store();
  var record = jsonConverter.mapToRecord(store, json);
  await store.add(database, record);
}
```

In the above code, we first create a `store` using the `intMapStoreFactory` provided by Sembast. Then, we convert the JSON object to a `Record` using the `mapToRecord` function from `sembast/json.dart`. Finally, we add the record to the database using the `add` method of the store.

## Deserializing JSON with Sembast

To deserialize JSON data using Sembast, we retrieve the data from the database and convert it back into a JSON object. The `jsonConverter` library in Sembast provides a handy function to achieve this.

Here's an example of deserializing a JSON object with Sembast:

```dart
import 'package:sembast/sembast.dart';
import 'package:sembast/json.dart' as jsonConverter;

Future<Map<String, dynamic>> deserializeJson(Database database, int key) async {
  var store = intMapStoreFactory.store();
  var recordSnapshot = await store.findFirst(database, finder: Finder(filter: Filter.byKey(key)));
  if (recordSnapshot != null) {
    return jsonConverter.recordToMap(recordSnapshot);
  }
  return null;
}
```

In the code snippet above, we use the `findFirst` method to retrieve the record from the database. We then convert the record to a JSON object using the `recordToMap` function from `sembast/json.dart`.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to serialize and deserialize JSON data using Sembast in Flutter. Serializing JSON is an important step when storing data in a database, while deserializing JSON allows us to retrieve and use the data in our app. With Sembast and the `dart:convert` library, handling JSON in Flutter becomes straightforward and efficient.
