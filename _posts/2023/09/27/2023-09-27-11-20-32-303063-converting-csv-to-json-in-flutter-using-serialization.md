CSV (Comma Separated Values) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) are two widely used data formats in software development. In this blog post, we will explore how to convert CSV data to JSON format in a Flutter application using serialization.

## Why convert CSV to JSON?

CSV files are commonly used for storing tabular data, while JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format. Converting CSV to JSON can be beneficial in scenarios where JSON is the preferred format for data processing or API communication.

## Flutter's serialization library

To convert CSV to JSON in Flutter, we can make use of the serialization library provided by Flutter. The serialization library allows us to map CSV data to Dart objects, and then convert those objects into JSON.

## Steps to convert CSV to JSON in Flutter:

### 1. Import the serialization library

First, we need to import the serialization library in our Dart file. Add the following import statement:

```dart
import 'package:csv/csv.dart';
```

### 2. Read the CSV file

Next, we need to read the CSV file and convert it into a list of rows. We can use the `CsvToListConverter` class provided by the `csv` package to achieve this. Here's an example:

```dart
final csvString = /* your CSV content */;
final converter = CsvToListConverter();
final csvList = converter.convert(csvString);
```

### 3. Map the CSV data to Dart objects

Once we have the CSV data in a list format, we can map it to Dart objects. Create a Dart class that represents the structure of each row in the CSV file. For example:

```dart
class Person {
  final String name;
  final int age;
  
  Person(this.name, this.age);
}
```

Now, we can iterate over the `csvList` and create instances of the `Person` class for each row:

```dart
final peopleList = csvList.map((row) {
  final name = row[0];
  final age = int.parse(row[1]);
  return Person(name, age);
}).toList();
```

### 4. Convert Dart objects to JSON

Finally, we can convert the list of Dart objects to JSON using the `jsonEncode` function provided by Flutter:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

final json = jsonEncode(peopleList);
```

Now, the `json` variable contains the JSON representation of the CSV data.

## Conclusion

Converting CSV to JSON in a Flutter application is made easy with the serialization library. By following the steps mentioned above, you can effectively convert CSV data to JSON format and leverage its benefits in your Flutter projects. #Flutter #CSVtoJSON
