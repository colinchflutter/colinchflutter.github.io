Updating user profiles is a common task in mobile applications, and it is important to handle these updates securely. In Flutter, the `http` package is commonly used for making API requests. In this tutorial, we will learn how to handle secure user profile updates using the `http` package in Flutter.

## Step 1: Set Up the `http` Package

Before we can start making API requests, we need to add the `http` package to our Flutter project. To do this, open your project's `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```yaml
http: ^0.13.3
```

Save the file and run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

## Step 2: Secure User Profile Update

To send secure user profile updates, we need to use HTTPS instead of HTTP. To ensure secure communication, we can use SSL Pinning, which involves validating the server's certificate against a pre-defined certificate or public key.

To implement SSL Pinning, we need to obtain the server's certificate or public key. Once we have that, we can validate it during the SSL handshake process.

Here's an example code snippet to handle a user profile update securely using the `http` package in Flutter:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> updateUserProfile(String userId, Map<String, dynamic> profileData) async {
  final Uri apiUrl = Uri.parse('https://your-api-url.com/profile/$userId');

  final http.Client client = http.Client();
  final http.Response response = await client.put(
    apiUrl,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      // Add any required headers, such as authentication token
    },
    body: jsonEncode(profileData),
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // Profile update successful
    print('Profile updated successfully');
  } else {
    // Profile update failed
    print('Profile update failed with status code: ${response.statusCode}');
  }

  client.close();
}
```

In the above code snippet, we first define the API URL for updating the user profile. We then create an instance of the `http.Client` class, which allows us to make HTTP requests.

Using the `client.put` method, we make a PUT request to the API URL with the necessary headers and the user profile data encoded as JSON. The response from the server is stored in the `http.Response` object.

Finally, we check the status code of the response. If it is 200, the profile update was successful. Otherwise, we handle the error accordingly.

Remember to handle any exceptions that may occur during the API request process.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to handle secure user profile updates using the `http` package in Flutter. By implementing SSL Pinning and sending HTTPS requests, we can ensure secure communication with the server.
