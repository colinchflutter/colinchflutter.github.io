When working with APIs in Flutter, it is common to receive responses in JSON format that need to be deserialized into Dart objects. The `http` package provides a convenient way to make HTTP requests in Flutter, and in this blog post, we will explore how to handle response deserialization using this package.

## Step 1: Make an HTTP Request

The first step is to make an HTTP request using the `http` package. Here is an example of how to make a GET request:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> fetchData() async {
  final response = await http.get('https://api.example.com/data');
  
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // Handle successful response
    // Deserialize the response body here
  } else {
    // Handle error response
    print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}.');
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Deserialize the Response Body

Once we receive the response, we can deserialize the response body into Dart objects. Flutter provides the `dart:convert` library, which includes the `jsonDecode` method for parsing JSON. 

Here is an example of how to deserialize the response body into a list of objects:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

Future<void> fetchData() async {
  final response = await http.get('https://api.example.com/data');
  
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // Deserialize the response body into a list of objects
    final List<dynamic> responseData = jsonDecode(response.body);
    
    // Process the deserialized data
    for (var item in responseData) {
      // Do something with each item
    }
  } else {
    // Handle error response
    print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}.');
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to handle response deserialization in Flutter using the `http` package. By making an HTTP request and deserializing the response body into Dart objects, we can easily work with API data in our Flutter applications.

Remember to import the necessary packages (`http` and `dart:convert`) and handle error responses gracefully. Happy coding with Flutter!
