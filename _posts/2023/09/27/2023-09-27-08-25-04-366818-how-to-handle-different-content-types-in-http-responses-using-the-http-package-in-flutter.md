Handling different content types in HTTP responses is a crucial aspect of building robust and flexible applications. In Flutter, the `http` package provides a convenient way to make HTTP requests and handle responses. In this blog post, we will explore how to effectively handle different content types in HTTP responses using the `http` package. 

## Installing the http package

First, let's start by adding the `http` package to your Flutter project. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line under the `dependencies` section:

```dart
dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.3
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` in the terminal to fetch the package.

## Importing the http package

Next, import the `http` package at the top of your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
```

## Making an HTTP request

To make an HTTP request, you can use the `get()` function from the `http` package. Here's an example of performing a GET request:

```dart
http.Response response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://example.com/api/data'));
```

## Handling different content types

Once you receive the HTTP response, you need to determine its content type to process it appropriately. The `http` package provides the `headers` property on the `response` object, which contains metadata including the content type. To get the content type from the response, use the `response.headers['content-type']` property.

Here's an example of determining the content type of the response:

```dart
String contentType = response.headers['content-type'];

if (contentType.contains('application/json')) {
  // Handle JSON response
  // ...
} else if (contentType.contains('text/html')) {
  // Handle HTML response
  // ...
} else {
  // Handle other content types
  // ...
}
```

### Handling JSON response

If the content type is JSON, you can use the `jsonDecode()` function from the `dart:convert` package to parse the response body into a Dart object.

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

// ...

if (contentType.contains('application/json')) {
  Map<String, dynamic> jsonData = jsonDecode(response.body);
  // Use the jsonData object
}
```

### Handling HTML response

If the content type is HTML, you can directly use the `response.body` string to display the HTML content.

```dart
import 'package:html/parser.dart' show parse;

// ...

if (contentType.contains('text/html')) {
  var document = parse(response.body);
  // Use the document object
}
```

## Conclusion

Handling different content types in HTTP responses is a crucial part of developing robust Flutter applications. In this blog post, we explored how to use the `http` package to make HTTP requests and handle responses based on their content types. By leveraging the provided techniques, you can easily handle JSON, HTML, and other content types in Flutter applications.
