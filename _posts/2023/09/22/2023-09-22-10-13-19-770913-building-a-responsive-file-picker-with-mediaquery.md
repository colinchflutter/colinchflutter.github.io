In this blog post, we will explore how to build a responsive file picker using the `MediaQuery` feature in CSS. With `MediaQuery`, we can control the styling and behavior of our file picker based on the screen size or other device characteristics. This is particularly useful when designing a file picker that seamlessly adapts to different devices and screen resolutions.

## What is `MediaQuery`?

`MediaQuery` is a CSS feature that allows us to apply different styles to elements based on various conditions such as screen size, orientation, device type, and more. It enables us to create responsive designs that dynamically adjust their layout and appearance to provide the best user experience on different devices.

## Requirements

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- A text editor
- A web browser

## Let's Get Started

1. **Setting up the HTML Markup**

To start, we need to create the HTML structure for our file picker. Here's a basic example:

```html
<form>
  <input type="file" id="filepicker" accept="image/*" />
  <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>
```

In this example, we have a simple form containing an input field of type `file`, with an `id` of `filepicker`. The `accept` attribute restricts the type of files that can be selected to only images. And finally, we have a submit button.

2. **Styling the File Picker**

Next, we can style the file picker to make it visually appealing. Here's some example CSS code:

```css
#filepicker {
  /* Add your custom styles here */
}

button[type="submit"] {
  /* Add your custom styles here */
}
```

Feel free to customize the styles to match your website's design.

3. **Adding Responsive Behavior with `MediaQuery`**

Now, let's make our file picker responsive by utilizing `MediaQuery`. We can adjust the layout and styling of the file picker based on the screen size. Here's an example:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for smaller screens */
  #filepicker {
    /* Add your custom styles here */
  }

  button[type="submit"] {
    /* Add your custom styles here */
  }
}

@media (min-width: 769px) {
  /* Styles for larger screens */
  #filepicker {
    /* Add your custom styles here */
  }

  button[type="submit"] {
    /* Add your custom styles here */
  }
}
```

In this example, we define two `MediaQuery` blocks. The first one applies styles for screens with a maximum width of 768px (smaller screens), and the second one applies styles for screens with a minimum width of 769px (larger screens). You can adjust the breakpoints and styles as per your project requirements.

4. **Handling File Upload**

Lastly, we need to handle the file upload functionality using JavaScript. Here's some simple code that demonstrates uploading a file when the form is submitted:

```javascript
const form = document.querySelector('form');
form.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  
  const fileInput = document.querySelector('#filepicker');
  const selectedFile = fileInput.files[0];
  
  // Perform file upload logic here
});
```

In this example, we select the form element and attach a submit event listener to it. On form submission, we prevent the default form submission behavior, retrieve the selected file from the file input, and perform the necessary file upload logic.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to build a responsive file picker using `MediaQuery`. We explored how to apply different styles based on screen size and enhance the user experience across various devices. With the flexibility provided by `MediaQuery`, we can create file pickers that seamlessly adapt to different screen resolutions, making them user-friendly and visually appealing.
