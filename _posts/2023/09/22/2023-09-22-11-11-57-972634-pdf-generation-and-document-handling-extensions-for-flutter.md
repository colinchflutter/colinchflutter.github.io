Flutter is a popular cross-platform framework for building mobile applications. It provides developers with a rich set of widgets and tools for creating beautiful and fast user interfaces. However, when it comes to handling documents and generating PDFs, Flutter lacks built-in capabilities.

Fortunately, there are several extensions available in the Flutter ecosystem that can help developers with PDF generation and document handling. In this blog post, we will explore two popular extensions: **pdf** and **printing**.

## PDF Extension: pdf

The **pdf** extension is a comprehensive PDF manipulation library for Flutter, developed by the Flutter team at Google. It allows developers to create, modify, and extract content from PDF documents.

With **pdf**, you can easily generate PDFs from scratch by adding text, images, and shapes to the document. You can also set properties such as page size, margins, and background color. The extension provides a simple and intuitive API, making it easy to create professional-looking PDFs.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to create a basic PDF using the **pdf** extension:

```dart
import 'package:pdf/pdf.dart';
import 'package:pdf/widgets.dart' as pw;

void generatePDF() {
  final pdf = pw.Document();

  pdf.addPage(
    pw.Page(
      build: (pw.Context context) {
        return pw.Center(
          child: pw.Text('Hello, World!', style: pw.TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
        );
      },
    ),
  );

  // Save the PDF to a file
  final output = File('example.pdf');
  output.writeAsBytesSync(pdf.save());
}
```

In this example, we import the required libraries, create a new `Document` object, add a page to the document, and then save the PDF to a file.

## Document Handling Extension: printing

The **printing** extension, also developed by the Flutter team, provides a set of APIs for printing documents and images. It allows you to generate PDFs and send them directly to a printer, as well as preview documents on screen before printing.

With **printing**, you can customize the layout and appearance of the printable content, including headers, footers, and page numbers. You can also handle printing-related events, such as the user selecting a printer or changing print settings.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use the **printing** extension to print a PDF document:

```dart
import 'package:pdf/pdf.dart';
import 'package:pdf/widgets.dart' as pw;
import 'package:printing/printing.dart';

void printPDF() async {
  final pdf = pw.Document();

  pdf.addPage(
    pw.Page(
      build: (pw.Context context) {
        return pw.Center(
          child: pw.Text('Hello, World!', style: pw.TextStyle(fontSize: 24)),
        );
      },
    ),
  );

  // Print the PDF
  final printer = Printing.iCloudPrinter;
  await Printing.layoutPdf(
    onLayout: (PdfPageFormat format) async => pdf.save(),
    name: 'example.pdf',
    printer: printer,
  );
}
```

In this example, we create a PDF document using the **pdf** extension, and then use the `layoutPdf` method from **printing** to send the document to the printer specified by `printer`.

## Conclusion

With the **pdf** and **printing** extensions, Flutter developers can easily handle documents and generate PDFs in their mobile applications. The **pdf** extension provides powerful PDF manipulation capabilities, while the **printing** extension adds printing support to Flutter apps.

By leveraging these extensions, developers can enhance the utility and functionality of their Flutter applications, making it easier for users to generate and work with PDF documents.
