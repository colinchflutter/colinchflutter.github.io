In today's fast-paced world, it is crucial to have a notification system in place to keep users informed about important updates and events. With the rise of mobile devices and varying screen sizes, it is important to have a notification system that can adapt to different device sizes and orientations.

In this blog post, we will explore how to build a responsive notification system using the `MediaQuery` feature. `MediaQuery` is a powerful tool provided by CSS that allows us to apply different styles based on various device characteristics.

## Step 1: Setting Up the HTML Structure

The first step is to set up the HTML structure for our notification system. We will use a `<div>` element to encapsulate our notifications.

```html
<div class="notification-container">
  <!-- Notifications will be dynamically appended here -->
</div>
```

## Step 2: Styling the Notification Container

Next, we need to define the basic styles for our notification container. We will center align the notifications and set a maximum width.

```css
.notification-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  max-width: 500px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

## Step 3: Creating Responsive Styles with MediaQuery

Now comes the exciting part: creating responsive styles using `MediaQuery`. We can define different CSS rules based on different device characteristics such as screen width or orientation.

Let's say we want our notification system to change its layout for devices with a maximum screen width of 600px. In this case, we can define a media query like this:

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .notification-container {
    flex-direction: column-reverse;
  }
}
```

This media query will reverse the order of the notifications for devices with a maximum screen width of 600px. You can modify this rule to suit your specific requirements.

## Step 4: Dynamically Adding Notifications with JavaScript

Finally, let's add some JavaScript code to dynamically add notifications to our notification system. We will use a function that takes the notification content as an argument and appends it to the notification container.

```javascript
function addNotification(content) {
  const notificationContainer = document.querySelector('.notification-container');

  const notification = document.createElement('div');
  notification.classList.add('notification');
  notification.textContent = content;

  notificationContainer.appendChild(notification);
}
```

You can call this function whenever you want to add a notification. For example:

```javascript
addNotification('New message received');
addNotification('Payment successful');
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to build a responsive notification system using `MediaQuery`. By leveraging `MediaQuery`, we can create a notification system that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

Remember to test your notification system on various devices to ensure it works as expected. With a responsive notification system in place, you can provide a seamless user experience across different devices.
