Flutter is a popular cross-platform framework for building mobile applications. When developing Flutter apps, you often need to interact with a database to store and retrieve data. While Flutter provides a built-in SQLite plugin for database operations, there are also several database handling extensions available that can simplify and enhance the database management process. In this blog post, we will explore some of these extensions that you can use in your Flutter projects.

## 1. Moor

[Moor](https://pub.dev/packages/moor) is a powerful database management library for Flutter inspired by Room, a similar library in the Android world. It allows you to define your database schema using Dart code and provides a fluent and type-safe API for database operations. Moor offers features like auto-generating code, query annotations, and stream-based queries, making it easier to work with databases in Flutter.

To use Moor, you need to define your database tables as Dart classes using annotations and then use the provided query methods to interact with the database. Below is an example of a Moor database table definition:

```dart
import 'package:moor/moor.dart';

@DataClassName("Todo")
class Todos extends Table {
  IntColumn get id => integer().autoIncrement()();
  TextColumn get title => text()();
  BoolColumn get completed => boolean().withDefault(const Constant(false))();
}
```

Moor also supports migrations, which enables you to evolve your database schema over time without losing data. With its seamless integration with Flutter, Moor provides a robust and efficient way to handle databases in your Flutter projects.

## 2. Hive

[Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) is a lightweight and fast key-value database designed specifically for Flutter and Dart. It offers simplicity and performance by storing data directly in memory, which makes it ideal for use cases such as caching or storing simple data structures. Hive achieves high-performance database operations by utilizing efficient binary serialization.

Using Hive is quite straightforward. You can define Hive boxes, which are essentially collections of key-value pairs, and interact with them using simple API methods. Here's an example of how you can store and retrieve data from a Hive box:

```dart
import 'package:hive/hive.dart';

void main() async {
  await Hive.initFlutter();
  await Hive.openBox('myBox');

  final box = Hive.box('myBox');
  box.put('name', 'John Doe');

  final name = box.get('name');

  print(name); // Output: John Doe

  await Hive.close();
}
```

Hive also offers integration with popular state management libraries like Provider and Riverpod, making it a versatile choice for managing your Flutter app's data storage needs.

# Conclusion

When working with databases in Flutter, using database handling extensions can greatly simplify the process and enhance the efficiency of your code. Extensions like Moor and Hive provide powerful and flexible options for handling databases, allowing you to focus on building great Flutter apps. Explore these extensions and choose the one that best suits your project's requirements and preferences.
