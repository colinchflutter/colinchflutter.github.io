As a Flutter developer, you may come across the need to integrate email functionality into your applications. Whether it's creating an inbox-like interface or integrating with Gmail directly, there are several extensions and packages available to help you achieve this seamlessly. In this blog post, we will explore two important extensions for email inbox and Gmail integration in Flutter.

## 1. flutter_email_sender

[flutter_email_sender](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_email_sender) is a Flutter package that allows you to send emails from your app. It provides a simple and straightforward interface to compose and send emails, making it easy to integrate email functionality into your application.

To use flutter_email_sender, add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_email_sender: ^5.0.1
```

Next, import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_email_sender/flutter_email_sender.dart';
```

Sending emails with flutter_email_sender is simple. Here's an example code snippet:

```dart
Email email = Email(
  body: 'Email body',
  subject: 'Email subject',
  recipients: ['recipient@example.com'],
  cc: ['cc@example.com'],
  bcc: ['bcc@example.com'],
  attachmentPaths: ['/path/to/attachment'],
);

await FlutterEmailSender.send(email);
```

You can customize the email by setting the body, subject, recipients, cc, bcc, and attachment paths according to your requirements. This package supports multiple attachments, making it ideal for applications that require sending emails with files.

## 2. flutter_gmail

If you're specifically looking to integrate with Gmail and access Gmail features within your Flutter app, [flutter_gmail](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gmail) is a great solution. This package provides a variety of features, including accessing inbox messages, composing new messages, and managing labels.

To integrate flutter_gmail into your project, add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_gmail: ^2.1.0
```

Import the package before using it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_gmail/flutter_gmail.dart';
```

Using flutter_gmail, you can authenticate with Gmail using OAuth2 and gain access to Gmail functionalities. Here's an example of how to use the package to fetch inbox messages:

```dart
GmailClient client = await FlutterGmail.login();
List<EmailMessage> inbox = await client.getMessages(
  query: 'in:inbox',
  maxResults: 10,
);

inbox.forEach((email) {
  print('Subject: ${email.subject}');
  print('From: ${email.from}');
  print('Snippet: ${email.snippet}');
});
```

This code will authenticate the user with Gmail and retrieve the 10 most recent inbox messages. You can customize the `query` parameter to filter messages based on specific criteria.

By leveraging the capabilities of flutter_email_sender and flutter_gmail, you can enhance your Flutter applications with email inbox and Gmail integration features. Whether you want to send emails or access Gmail functionalities, these extensions provide a convenient and efficient way to achieve your goals.
