## What is MediaQuery?

`MediaQuery` helps you fetch the current media data, such as the size and orientation of the screen, and use that information to dynamically adapt your layout accordingly. It allows you to create flexible designs that can adjust to different devices seamlessly.

## How to Use MediaQuery?

To use `MediaQuery`, follow these steps:

1. Import the required packages:
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

2. Wrap your widget tree with a `MaterialApp`:
```
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Responsive Layout Example',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}
```
  
3. Inside your widget tree, use `MediaQuery` to access the device's size and orientation:
```
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final size = MediaQuery.of(context).size;
    final orientation = MediaQuery.of(context).orientation;

    // Use size and orientation to adjust your layout
    // based on different screen sizes
    // ...

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Responsive Layout Example'),
      ),
      body: Container(
        // ...
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

4. Use the `size` and `orientation` variables to dynamically adjust your layout based on different screen sizes and orientations. For example, you can conditionally render different widgets or adjust spacing and font sizes accordingly.

## Conclusion

By using `MediaQuery`, you can easily create responsive layouts for different screen sizes and orientations. This ensures that your website or application looks great on a variety of devices, providing a better user experience. Keep in mind the importance of responsive design and make your applications accessible to a wider audience.
