In today's modern web design, it's crucial to create responsive websites that adapt to various screen sizes and devices. One important element to consider is the header of the website, which should remain visible and accessible even when users scroll down the page. In this blog post, we'll explore how to create a responsive sticky header using `MediaQuery` in CSS.

#### Why Use MediaQuery?

`MediaQuery` allows us to apply different styles to our elements based on specific conditions, such as screen size, device orientation, or other media features. By utilizing `MediaQuery`, we can easily adapt our header to different screen sizes and ensure an optimal user experience on all devices.

#### Step 1: Create the HTML Structure

Before diving into the CSS, let's first create the basic HTML structure for our header. Here's an example:

```html
<header>
  <div class="logo">Logo</div>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
```

In this example, we have a header element that contains a logo and a navigation menu.

#### Step 2: Apply Basic Styling

Next, let's add some basic styling to our header. We'll set the background color, font, and layout properties. Here's an example:

```css
header {
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 10px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

.logo {
  font-size: 18px;
}

nav ul {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

nav li {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-left: 10px;
}

nav li a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #fff;
}
```

In this example, we've set the background color of the header to `#333` and the text color to `#fff`. We've also applied some basic styling to the logo and navigation elements.

#### Step 3: Create Sticky Behavior

To make our header sticky, we'll use the `position: fixed;` property. When the user scrolls down the page, the header will remain fixed at the top. However, we only want the sticky behavior to be applied on larger screens, not on smaller mobile devices. That's where `MediaQuery` comes in.

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  header {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
  }
}
```

In this example, we've applied the `position: fixed;` property inside a `MediaQuery` with a minimum screen width of `768px`. This ensures that the sticky behavior is only applied on screens larger than 768 pixels.

#### Step 4: Fine-tune Additional Styles

Finally, you can fine-tune the additional styles for your sticky header to make it visually appealing. This may include adjusting the logo size, adding animations or transitions, or changing the background color when the header becomes sticky.

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  header {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: #333;
    padding: 10px;
    color: #fff;
    transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in;
  }

  .logo {
    font-size: 20px;
  }

  header.sticky {
    background-color: #222;
  }
}
```

In this example, we've added a transition effect to smoothly change the background color when the header becomes sticky. We've also increased the font size of the logo when the header is sticky, giving it more prominence.

#### Conclusion

By utilizing `MediaQuery` in CSS, we can easily create a responsive sticky header that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures that our website offers a seamless user experience across various platforms. With a little creativity, you can further enhance the appearance and behavior of your sticky header.
