In today's digital age, videos play an essential role in capturing and retaining audience attention on websites. With the increasing variety of devices and screen sizes, it's crucial to create responsive video players that adapt to different platforms seamlessly. In this blog post, we will explore how to build a responsive video player using `MediaQuery`.

## What is `MediaQuery`?

`MediaQuery` is a CSS feature that allows you to conditionally apply styles based on the characteristics of the user's device and viewport. It enables responsiveness by defining different CSS rules for different screen sizes, orientations, and other media features.

## Steps to Build a Responsive Video Player

### Step 1: Structure the HTML

The first step is to structure the HTML for the video player. Here's an example:

```html
<div class="video-player">
  <video src="video.mp4" controls></video>
</div>
```

### Step 2: Style the Video Player

Next, we need to style the video player using CSS. For simplicity, we'll apply basic styles:

```css
.video-player {
  max-width: 100%;
}

video {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

### Step 3: Adding `MediaQuery` for Responsiveness

To make the video player responsive, we'll use `MediaQuery` to define different styles for different screen sizes. Here's an example:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  video {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1200px) {
  video {
    width: 75%;
    height: auto;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1201px) {
  video {
    width: 50%;
    height: auto;
  }
}
```

In the above code, we defined three `MediaQuery` rules. The first rule applies when the screen width is 768 pixels or less, the second rule applies when the screen width is between 769 and 1200 pixels, and the third rule applies when the screen width is greater than 1200 pixels.

### Step 4: Test and Enhance

Finally, test the responsive video player on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it adapts correctly. Make further adjustments and enhancements as needed to provide the best viewing experience across devices.

## Conclusion

By utilizing the power of `MediaQuery`, we can create a responsive video player that dynamically adapts to the user's screen size and device. This ensures a seamless and enjoyable video playback experience, regardless of the platform. Incorporate this technique into your web development projects to enhance the user experience and engage your audience effectively.
