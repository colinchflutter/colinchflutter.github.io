In today's digital world, accessing data from the web and extracting relevant information has become an essential task for many mobile applications. Flutter, a popular cross-platform framework, offers convenient ways to perform web scraping and data extraction.

## 1. Flutter Web View

Flutter Web View is a powerful plugin that allows developers to display web content within their Flutter applications. It provides various methods to interact with the web page, making it an ideal tool for web scraping.

To use Flutter Web View for data extraction, you can follow these steps:

1. Add the `flutter_webview_plugin` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file.
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_webview_plugin: ^0.3.11
```

2. Import the package in your Dart file.
```dart
import 'package:flutter_webview_plugin/flutter_webview_plugin.dart';
```

3. Create a `WebviewScaffold` widget and configure it to load the desired web page.
```dart
WebviewScaffold(
  url: 'https://example.com',
  withJavascript: true,
  withLocalStorage: true,
  hidden: true,
  initialChild: Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()),
)
```

4. Access the loaded web page using JavaScript methods and extract relevant data using regular expressions or DOM traversal.

Flutter Web View provides flexible options to extract data from the loaded web page. By utilizing JavaScript methods like `evaluateJavascript()` or `getUrl()`, developers can retrieve page content and perform data extraction operations.

## 2. http and html packages

Another way to perform web scraping and data extraction in Flutter is by using the `http` and `html` packages. These packages allow developers to make HTTP requests, retrieve web content, and parse HTML documents.

To use the `http` and `html` packages for web scraping, you can follow these steps:

1. Add the `http` and `html` dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file.
```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.3
  html: ^0.15.0
```

2. Import the packages in your Dart file.
```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:html/parser.dart' as htmlParser;
import 'package:html/dom.dart' as htmlDom;
```

3. Make an HTTP request to fetch the web page content.
```dart
final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://example.com'));
```

4. Parse the HTML document using the `htmlParser` package.
```dart
final document = htmlParser.parse(response.body);
```

5. Extract relevant data from the parsed HTML document using CSS selectors or DOM traversal methods.
```dart
final titleElement = document.querySelector('title');
print(titleElement.text);

final links = document.querySelectorAll('a');
for (final link in links) {
  print(link.attributes['href']);
}
```

By using the `http` and `html` packages, developers can retrieve web page content and perform data extraction operations based on their requirements.
