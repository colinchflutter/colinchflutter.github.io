[flutter_ffmpeg](https://github.com/tanersener/flutter-ffmpeg) is a powerful video processing library for Flutter that wraps FFmpeg, a widely-used multimedia framework. It allows you to perform various operations like transcoding, format conversion, filtering, muxing, and more. With flutter_ffmpeg, you have complete control over video processing and can easily integrate it into your Flutter projects.

To use flutter_ffmpeg, you need to add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_ffmpeg: ^x.x.x
```

Replace `^x.x.x` with the latest version of flutter_ffmpeg. Make sure to run `flutter pub get` to fetch the dependency.

Now, you can start using flutter_ffmpeg by importing it into your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_ffmpeg/flutter_ffmpeg.dart';
