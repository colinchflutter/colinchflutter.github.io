The `geolocator` extension provides a simple and straightforward way to retrieve the current device location and track the location changes in real-time. It offers various features like getting the latitude and longitude coordinates, calculating distance between two points, and reverse geocoding to obtain detailed information about a location based on its coordinates. This extension supports both Android and iOS platforms and can be easily integrated into your Flutter project.

To use `geolocator` in your Flutter app, simply add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  geolocator: ^8.0.0
```

For more details and examples on how to use `geolocator`, you can refer to its [official documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator).

The `google_maps_flutter` extension allows you to embed Google Maps into your Flutter app and customize the map's appearance and functionality. It provides various features like adding markers, polylines, and polygons to the map, displaying user's current location on the map, and handling user interactions like taps and swipes on the map.

To integrate `google_maps_flutter` into your Flutter project, you need to add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
