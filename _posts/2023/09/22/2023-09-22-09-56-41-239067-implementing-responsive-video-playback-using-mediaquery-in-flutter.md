In today's digital world, video content has become a vital part of many applications. As a developer, it's crucial to ensure that the video playback is responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes and orientations. Flutter provides a powerful class called `MediaQuery` that allows us to achieve responsive video playback effortlessly.

## What is MediaQuery?

`MediaQuery` is a Flutter class that provides information about the current media or screen size. It gives us access to various properties such as the screen dimensions, pixel density, and orientation. By leveraging these properties, we can customize our app's layout and behavior for different device types and screen sizes.

## Implementing Responsive Video Playback

To implement responsive video playback using `MediaQuery` in Flutter, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary Flutter packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
```

2. Create a `StatefulWidget` that represents the video player widget:

```dart
class ResponsiveVideoPlayer extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ResponsiveVideoPlayerState createState() => _ResponsiveVideoPlayerState();
}
```

3. Inside the state class `_ResponsiveVideoPlayerState`, implement the video player functionality using Flutter's video_player package or any other video player plugin you prefer.

4. Wrap the video player widget with a `LayoutBuilder` widget to get the current device screen dimensions:

```dart
LayoutBuilder(
  builder: (BuildContext context, BoxConstraints constraints) {
    final double screenWidth = constraints.maxWidth;
    final double screenHeight = constraints.maxHeight;

    // Now you have access to the screen dimensions, and you can adjust the video playback accordingly

    return YourVideoPlayerWidget();
  },
)
```

5. Customize the video player's behavior or size based on the screen dimensions. For example, you can set different video resolutions or aspect ratios based on the device screen size:

```dart
double videoWidth;
double videoHeight;

if (screenWidth >= 600) {
  // For larger screens, use a wider video player with a different resolution
  videoWidth = screenWidth;
  videoHeight = screenWidth * 0.6; // 60% aspect ratio
} else {
  // For smaller screens, use a narrower video player with a different resolution
  videoWidth = screenWidth;
  videoHeight = screenWidth * 0.8; // 80% aspect ratio
}

return SizedBox(
  width: videoWidth,
  height: videoHeight,
  child: YourVideoPlayerWidget(),
);
```

6. Finally, integrate the `ResponsiveVideoPlayer` widget into your app's UI using the desired layout.

## Conclusion

With `MediaQuery`, implementing responsive video playback in Flutter becomes a breeze. By adapting your video player's behavior and layout based on the current screen size and orientation, you can provide a seamless video viewing experience across various devices and platforms.
