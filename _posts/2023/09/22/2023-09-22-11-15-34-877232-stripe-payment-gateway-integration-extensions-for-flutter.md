Flutter is a popular cross-platform framework for building beautiful native applications for mobile, web, and desktop platforms using a single codebase. When it comes to integrating payment gateways into Flutter apps, **Stripe** is one of the leading options due to its simplicity, reliability, and wide support.

In this article, we will explore some **Stripe payment gateway integration extensions** available for Flutter, allowing developers to easily integrate Stripe payment functionality into their Flutter apps.

    // Process the payment
    final paymentIntent = await Stripe.instance.confirmPaymentIntent(
      'YOUR_PAYMENT_INTENT_CLIENT_SECRET',
      paymentMethod.id,
    );

    if (paymentIntent?.status == PaymentIntentsStatus.succeeded) {
      print('Payment succeeded');
