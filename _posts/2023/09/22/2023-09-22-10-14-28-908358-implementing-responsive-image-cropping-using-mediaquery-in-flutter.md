In a mobile app, it's important to display images that are optimized for different screen sizes and resolutions. One common requirement is to crop images dynamically based on the available space. Flutter provides the `MediaQuery` widget that can be used to achieve responsive image cropping.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement responsive image cropping using `MediaQuery` in Flutter:

## Step 1: Add the dependencies
Open your Flutter project and add the `flutter_svg` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. This package will allow us to work with SVG images.

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_svg: ^0.22.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to download the dependencies.

## Step 2: Set up the UI
Create a new Flutter widget (e.g., `ResponsiveImageCrop`) that will contain the image. Inside the widget, use the `MediaQuery` widget to get the available screen size:

```dart
class ResponsiveImageCrop extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final screenSize = MediaQuery.of(context).size;
    
    // Rest of the code
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Crop the image
To crop the image, you can use the `SvgPicture.asset` widget from the `flutter_svg` package. Calculate the desired width and height of the crop based on the available screen size:

```dart
final imageWidth = screenSize.width * 0.8; // 80% of the available width
final imageHeight = screenSize.height * 0.6; // 60% of the available height

return SvgPicture.asset(
  'assets/images/my_image.svg', // Replace with your image asset
  width: imageWidth,
  height: imageHeight,
  fit: BoxFit.cover,
);
```

Make sure to replace `'assets/images/my_image.svg'` with the path to your image asset.

## Step 4: Run the app
To see the responsive image cropping in action, run your app on different devices or screen sizes. The image will automatically adjust its dimensions to fit the available space while maintaining the crop.

## Conclusion
By utilizing the `MediaQuery` widget in Flutter, we can easily implement responsive image cropping that adapts to different screen sizes. This ensures that images are displayed optimally and provide the best user experience.
