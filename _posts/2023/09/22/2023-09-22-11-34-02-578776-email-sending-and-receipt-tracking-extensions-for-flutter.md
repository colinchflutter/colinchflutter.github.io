Email communication plays a crucial role in today's digital world, and having the ability to send and track emails seamlessly within your Flutter application can greatly enhance user experience and productivity. In this blog post, we will explore two powerful extensions for Flutter that provide email sending and receipt tracking capabilities.

## 1. flutter_email_sender Extension

The `flutter_email_sender` extension is a plugin for Flutter that allows you to send emails directly from your application. It provides a simple and intuitive API for composing and sending emails, with support for attachments, CC, BCC, and HTML content.

To get started, add the `flutter_email_sender` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_email_sender: ^5.0.0
```

Next, import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_email_sender/flutter_email_sender.dart';
```

Now, you can compose and send emails using the following code snippet:

```dart
final Email email = Email(
  body: 'Hello, this is the body of the email.',
  subject: 'Flutter Email Sender',
  recipients: ['example@example.com'],
  cc: ['cc@example.com'],
  bcc: ['bcc@example.com'],
  attachmentPaths: ['/path/to/file.pdf'],
  isHTML: false,
);

await FlutterEmailSender.send(email);
```

With the `flutter_email_sender` extension, you can easily integrate email sending functionality into your Flutter app, enabling users to send emails without leaving the application.

## 2. mailgun_tracking Extension

The `mailgun_tracking` extension is a Flutter plugin that enables email receipt tracking using Mailgun services. It allows you to track email opens and link clicks within your Flutter application, providing valuable insights into user engagement.

To get started, add the `mailgun_tracking` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  mailgun_tracking: ^0.1.0
```

Next, import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:mailgun_tracking/mailgun_tracking.dart';
```

To track email opens and link clicks, you need to use the Mailgun API. Here's an example of how you can implement this in your Flutter app:

```dart
final client = MailgunTracking(
  domain: '<your-mailgun-domain>',
  apiKey: '<your-mailgun-api-key>',
);

final result = await client.track(event: Event.open, messageId: '<message-id>');
if (result.success) {
  // Tracking successful
} else {
  // Tracking failed
}
```

With the `mailgun_tracking` extension, you can easily integrate email receipt tracking into your Flutter app and gain valuable insights into user engagement.
