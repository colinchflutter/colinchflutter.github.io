In this blog post, we'll discuss how to design a responsive progress ring using `MediaQuery` in CSS. A progress ring is a circular representation of progress, commonly used in loading screens and progress indicators. By making the progress ring responsive, we ensure that it adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

## Setting up the HTML Structure

Let's start by setting up the HTML structure for the progress ring. We'll use a `div` element as the container for our progress ring, and an inner `div` element as the progress indicator.

```html
<div class="progress-ring-container">
  <div class="progress-ring"></div>
</div>
```

## Designing the Progress Ring in CSS

Next, we'll style the progress ring using CSS. We'll set the dimensions, colors, and other properties to achieve the desired look and feel.

```css
.progress-ring-container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: #e6e6e6;
  position: relative;
}

.progress-ring {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  border-radius: 50%;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  background-color: #f2c94c;
  /* Additional styling properties */
}
```

The `progress-ring-container` class defines the dimensions and background color of the container, while the `progress-ring` class defines its dimensions, position, and background color.

## Making the Progress Ring Responsive with MediaQuery

To make the progress ring responsive, we'll use `MediaQuery` to apply different styles based on the screen size. We'll add additional CSS rules inside a `@media` rule to target specific screen sizes.

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .progress-ring-container {
    width: 150px;
    height: 150px;
  }
  
  /* Additional responsive styles */
}

@media (max-width: 480px) {
  .progress-ring-container {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
  }
  
  /* Additional responsive styles */
}
```

In the above examples, we've defined different dimensions for the progress ring container at screen sizes of 768px and 480px. You can customize these values according to your design requirements.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we've explored how to design a responsive progress ring using `MediaQuery`. By applying different styles based on screen sizes, we ensure that the progress ring adapts and looks great on various devices. Feel free to customize the styles and add animations to enhance the user experience.
