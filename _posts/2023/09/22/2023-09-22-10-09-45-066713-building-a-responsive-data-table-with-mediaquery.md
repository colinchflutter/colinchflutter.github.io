In this blog post, we will learn how to build a responsive data table using the `MediaQuery` API. A data table is a common component used in web applications to display tabular data in an organized way. To ensure that our data table looks good and functions properly on different screen sizes, we will leverage the power of `MediaQuery` to apply responsive styles dynamically.

## What is MediaQuery?

`MediaQuery` is a feature in CSS that allows you to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the user's device. With `MediaQuery`, you can target specific screen sizes, screen ratios, device orientations, and more. It provides a way to make your website or application responsive by adapting the layout and styles according to the user's device.

## Steps to Build a Responsive Data Table

### Step 1: HTML Markup

First, let's create the basic HTML structure for our data table. We will use `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<th>` tags to define the table structure and table headers.

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Email</th>
      <th>Phone</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>John Doe</td>
      <td>john.doe@example.com</td>
      <td>1234567890</td>
    </tr>
    <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
  </tbody>
</table>
```

### Step 2: Apply Basic Styling

Next, let's apply some basic styles to our data table to make it visually appealing. We can use CSS to define colors, fonts, borders, and padding for the table and its elements.

```css
table {
  width: 100%;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}

thead {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
}

th, td {
  padding: 10px;
  text-align: left;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
}

/* Add more styling as per your preference */
```

### Step 3: Add Responsive Styles with MediaQuery

Now comes the interesting part! We will use `MediaQuery` to apply different styles to our data table based on the screen size. For example, we may want to change the font size or hide certain columns on smaller screens to make the table more user-friendly.

```css
/* Apply styles for screens larger than 600px */
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  th, td {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
}

/* Apply styles for screens smaller than 600px */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  th:nth-child(2),
  td:nth-child(2) {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

In the above example, we have applied different font sizes for screens larger than 600px and hidden the second column on screens smaller than 600px.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the power of `MediaQuery`, we can create a responsive data table that adapts to different screen sizes and provides a seamless user experience. We learned how to build a basic data table using HTML and CSS and then applied responsive styles using `MediaQuery`. Feel free to experiment further and customize the styles as per your specific requirements.
