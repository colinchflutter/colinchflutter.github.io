The `MediaQuery` class in Flutter provides information about the screen size, device orientation, pixel density, and more. By using `MediaQuery`, you can build your app to dynamically adapt its layout and behavior based on the device it's running on. This is especially useful for creating apps that need to look great and function well on both phones and tablets.

To use the `MediaQuery` class, you can access it via the `MediaQuery.of(context)` method, where `context` is an instance of the `BuildContext` class. This method returns a `MediaQueryData` object that contains all the relevant information about the device's screen.

For example, to retrieve the screen's width and height, you can use the following code:

```dart
MediaQueryData mediaQueryData = MediaQuery.of(context);
double screenWidth = mediaQueryData.size.width;
double screenHeight = mediaQueryData.size.height;
```

You can also check the device's orientation using the `orientation` property of the `MediaQueryData` object. Here's an example:

```dart
MediaQueryData mediaQueryData = MediaQuery.of(context);
Orientation deviceOrientation = mediaQueryData.orientation;

if (deviceOrientation == Orientation.portrait) {
  // Do something when the device is in portrait mode
} else if (deviceOrientation == Orientation.landscape) {
  // Do something when the device is in landscape mode
}
```

In addition to screen dimensions and orientation, `MediaQuery` provides other useful properties like `devicePixelRatio` (for obtaining the pixel density), `textScaleFactor` (for adjusting the text size based on user preferences), and more. These properties can be accessed in a similar way as shown in the above examples.

By leveraging the power of `MediaQuery`, you can create responsive and adaptive Flutter apps that provide a great user experience across a variety of devices. Whether you're targeting phones, tablets, or even larger screens, `MediaQuery` is an essential tool for building flexible and visually appealing mobile applications.
