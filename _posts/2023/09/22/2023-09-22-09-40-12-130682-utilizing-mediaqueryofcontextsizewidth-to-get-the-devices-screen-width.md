The `MediaQuery` class provides access to various information about the application's media, including the device's screen size. By calling `MediaQuery.of(context)`, we can obtain the `MediaQueryData` object, which contains information such as the device's screen width and height.

To retrieve the device's screen width, we can simply access the `width` property of the `MediaQueryData` object. Here's an example:

```dart
double screenWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
```

In the above code, we store the device's screen width in the `screenWidth` variable. This value can be used to adjust the layout or make responsive decisions based on the available screen space.

For instance, if you want to display different UI elements or adjust their sizes for different screen widths, you can use conditional statements like:

```dart
if (screenWidth > 600) {
  // Display a different layout for larger screens
  // or adjust the size of certain elements
} else {
  // Display a different layout for smaller screens
  // or adjust the size of certain elements
}
```

By utilizing `MediaQuery.of(context).size.width`, you have access to the device's screen width, allowing you to create responsive and adaptable user interfaces for your Flutter applications. Remember to import the necessary packages and use this property wisely to create a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
