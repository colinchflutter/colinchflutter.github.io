In today's tech-driven world, creating responsive designs is crucial to ensure that our applications work seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes. One essential element of a user-friendly interface is a progress bar that accurately represents the completion status of a task or process. In this blog post, we will explore how to create a responsive progress bar using the `MediaQuery` feature in CSS.

## What is MediaQuery? ##

`MediaQuery` is a CSS feature that allows us to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device or viewport. By specifying different CSS rules for specific screen sizes or device features, we can create responsive designs that adapt to various environments.

## Step 1: HTML Structure ##

Let's start by creating the HTML structure for our progress bar:

```html
<div class="progress-bar">
  <div class="progress"></div>
</div>
```

## Step 2: CSS Styling ##

Next, we will apply CSS styles to create the progress bar:

```css
.progress-bar {
  background-color: #eee;
  width: 100%;
  height: 20px;
}

.progress {
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #ff5722;
  width: 0;
}
```
In the above code, we set the background color of the progress bar to `#eee` and specify its width and height. We also define the styling for the progress element by setting its height to `100%`, background color to `#ff5722` (you can change it to any color you prefer), and initial width to `0`.

## Step 3: Using MediaQuery ##

To make our progress bar responsive, we will use `MediaQuery` to adjust its width based on screen size. We will define two breakpoints: one for smaller screens where the progress bar occupies the entire width, and another for larger screens where it takes up only 50% of the width. Let's see how it's done:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .progress {
    width: 100%;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 769px) {
  .progress {
    width: 50%;
  }
}
```

In the above code, we use `@media` queries to specify different CSS rules based on the screen size. For screens smaller than or equal to 768px, the progress element's width is set to `100%`, allowing it to occupy the entire width of the progress bar div. For screens larger than 768px, the width is set to `50%`, making the progress bar take up half of the width.

## Conclusion ##

In this blog post, we learned how to create a responsive progress bar using `MediaQuery` in CSS. By applying different styles based on screen size, we can ensure that our progress bar adapts to various devices and provides a consistent user experience. Incorporating responsive design techniques like this can greatly enhance the usability and accessibility of our applications.
