## Introduction
Video streaming has become increasingly popular in today's digital world. If you are looking to build a custom video streaming platform, Flutter is a great choice due to its cross-platform capabilities. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to create a video streaming platform in Flutter utilizing aspect ratio widgets.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Flutter and its concepts. Additionally, ensure that you have Flutter installed on your system.

## Getting Started
1. **Create a new Flutter project:** Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Flutter project:
```
flutter create video_streaming_platform
```

2. **Add dependencies:** Open the `pubspec.yaml` file in your project directory and add the following dependencies:
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  video_player: ^2.2.5
  chewie: ^1.2.2
```
Save the file and run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to download the dependencies.

3. **Create a video player screen:** Replace the code in the `lib/main.dart` file with the following code:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';
import 'package:chewie/chewie.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Video Streaming Platform',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: VideoPlayerScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoPlayerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoPlayerScreenState createState() => _VideoPlayerScreenState();
}

class _VideoPlayerScreenState extends State<VideoPlayerScreen> {
  VideoPlayerController _videoPlayerController;
  ChewieController _chewieController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _videoPlayerController = VideoPlayerController.network(
        'https://example.com/video.mp4');
    _chewieController = ChewieController(
      videoPlayerController: _videoPlayerController,
      autoPlay: true,
      looping: true,
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _videoPlayerController.dispose();
    _chewieController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Player'),
      ),
      body: AspectRatio(
        aspectRatio: _videoPlayerController.value.aspectRatio,
        child: Chewie(
          controller: _chewieController,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Explanation
- We start by importing the necessary packages: `video_player` and `chewie`.
- The video player screen is created as a stateful widget, `_VideoPlayerScreenState`, which extends `State<VideoPlayerScreen>`.
- In the `_VideoPlayerScreenState` class, we create instances of `VideoPlayerController` and `ChewieController` in the `initState` method.
- The `VideoPlayerController` is initialized with the network video URL.
- The `ChewieController` is configured with autoplay and looping options.
- In the `build` method, we use the `AspectRatio` widget to maintain the proper aspect ratio for the video.
- The `Chewie` widget is used to display the video player with the given controller.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to build a custom video streaming platform using Flutter. We explored the usage of aspect ratio widgets along with the `video_player` and `chewie` packages. Feel free to enhance the app with additional features like playlists, user authentication, and more. Happy coding!
