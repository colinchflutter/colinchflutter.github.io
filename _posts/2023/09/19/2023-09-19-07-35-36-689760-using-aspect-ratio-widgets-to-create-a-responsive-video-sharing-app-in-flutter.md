In today's digital age, video sharing apps have become increasingly popular. With the rise of platforms like YouTube and TikTok, people are consuming and sharing videos more than ever before. If you're looking to build a video sharing app using Flutter, it's important to ensure that your app is responsive and displays videos correctly on different devices and screen sizes.

One way to achieve a responsive video layout is by using **Aspect Ratio widgets** in Flutter. Aspect Ratio widgets allow you to define the aspect ratio of a child widget, ensuring that it maintains its proportions regardless of the screen size. Let's dive into how you can leverage Aspect Ratio widgets to create a responsive video sharing app.

## Setting Up the Project

First, you need to set up a new Flutter project on your machine. Open your IDE and create a new Flutter project using the Flutter CLI or the IDE's built-in project creation wizard. Once the project is set up, navigate to the project folder using the command line.

## Adding Dependencies

To use Aspect Ratio widgets in Flutter, you need to add the necessary dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  aspect_ratio_widget: ^1.0.2
```

After adding the dependencies, save the file and run the `flutter pub get` command to download the packages.

## Creating the Video Widget

Now, let's create the video widget that will display the videos in your app. In your project folder, navigate to the `lib` directory and open the `main.dart` file.

Inside the `main.dart` file, remove the default code and add the following imports at the top:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:aspect_ratio_widget/aspect_ratio_widget.dart';
```

Next, define a new class called `VideoWidget` that extends `StatelessWidget` in the body of the `main.dart` file:

```dart
class VideoWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AspectRatio(
      aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
      child: Container(
        color: Colors.black,
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            "Video Player",
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 32),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the `VideoWidget` class, we use the `AspectRatio` widget to define the aspect ratio of our video player. The `aspectRatio` property is set to `16 / 9`, which is a common aspect ratio for videos. You can adjust this value according to your needs.

Inside the `Container` widget, we set the background color to black and add a `Center` widget with a `Text` widget to simulate the video player UI.

## Displaying the Video Widget

To display the `VideoWidget`, modify the `build` method in the `MyApp` class as follows:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Video Sharing App',
      theme: ThemeData.dark(),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Video Sharing App'),
        ),
        body: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
          child: Center(
            child: VideoWidget(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code snippet, we wrap the `VideoWidget` with a `Center` widget and add some padding to center the video widget on the screen.

## Running the App

Save your changes and run your app using the `flutter run` command in the terminal. You should see the video widget with the text "Video Player" in the center of the screen. The video widget will maintain the correct aspect ratio on different screen sizes.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to use **Aspect Ratio widgets** in Flutter to create a responsive video sharing app. By leveraging Flutter's powerful widgets, you can ensure that your app displays videos correctly on various devices and screen sizes. Aspect Ratio widgets allow you to define the aspect ratio of a child widget, maintaining its proportions and ensuring a responsive video layout.

Remember to optimize your app for performance and consider implementing additional features like video streaming and playback controls to enhance the user experience.
