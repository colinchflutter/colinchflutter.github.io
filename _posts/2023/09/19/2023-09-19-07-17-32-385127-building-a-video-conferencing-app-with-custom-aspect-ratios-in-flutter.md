In today's blog post, we will explore how to build a video conferencing app with custom aspect ratios using the Flutter framework. Video conferencing has become an integral part of remote work and virtual communication, and custom aspect ratios can help enhance the viewing experience for participants.

## Understanding Aspect Ratios

Aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between the width and height of an image or video. The most common aspect ratios are 16:9 (widescreen) and 4:3 (standard). However, in a video conferencing app, it may be desirable to support custom aspect ratios to accommodate different screen sizes and layouts.

## Setting Up the Flutter Project

To get started, make sure to have Flutter installed on your machine. Create a new Flutter project by running the following command in your terminal:

```dart
flutter create video_conferencing_app
```

Once the project is created, navigate into the project directory:

```dart
cd video_conferencing_app
```

## Adding Dependencies

We need to add the `agora_rtc_engine` dependency to our `pubspec.yaml` file. This package provides audio and video calling capabilities for Flutter apps. Add the following code to the `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  agora_rtc_engine: ^0.14.0
  ...
```

Save the file and run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to fetch the dependencies.

## Implementing Custom Aspect Ratios

To implement custom aspect ratios, we can leverage the `AspectRatio` widget provided by Flutter. This widget allows us to define the aspect ratio of its child widget. 

In your Flutter project, open the main.dart file and replace the default code with the following snippet:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:agora_rtc_engine/rtc_engine.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Video Conferencing App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: VideoConferencePage(),
    );
  }
}

class VideoConferencePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _VideoConferencePageState createState() => _VideoConferencePageState();
}

class _VideoConferencePageState extends State<VideoConferencePage> {
  RtcEngine _rtcEngine;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initializeRTC();
  }

  Future<void> initializeRTC() async {
    // Initialize the RtcEngine
    _rtcEngine = await RtcEngine.create('YOUR_APP_ID');
    // Set up the video configuration
    await _rtcEngine.enableVideo();
    await _rtcEngine.setChannelProfile(ChannelProfile.Communication);
    await _rtcEngine.setVideoEncoderConfiguration(VideoEncoderConfiguration(
      dimensions: VideoDimensions(1280, 720),
      frameRate: VideoFrameRate.Fps30,
      orientationMode: VideoOutputOrientationMode.Adaptative,
    ));
    // Join the video conference
    await _rtcEngine.joinChannel(null, 'YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME', null, 0);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Leave the video conference and destroy the RtcEngine instance
    _rtcEngine.leaveChannel();
    _rtcEngine.destroy();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Conference'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: AspectRatio(
          aspectRatio: 16 / 9, // Set your custom aspect ratio here
          child: Container(
            color: Colors.black,
            // Implement your video rendering logic here
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_APP_ID'` with your actual Agora App ID, and `'YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME'` with a unique channel name for your video conference.

In the code above, we initialize the `RtcEngine`, set up the video configuration, join the video conference, and implement the UI with the custom aspect ratio using the `AspectRatio` widget.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to build a video conferencing app with custom aspect ratios using Flutter. The Flutter framework and the Agora RTC Engine package make it easy to create feature-rich video conferencing experiences tailored to your specific needs. Experiment with different aspect ratios to find the ideal viewing format for your users.
