In today's digital era, video ads have become an essential part of marketing strategies. With Flutter, a powerful cross-platform framework, it is possible to create stunning and interactive mobile applications that can seamlessly integrate video ads.

One critical aspect to consider when integrating video ads is the aspect ratio. The aspect ratio determines the width and height relationship of the video, ensuring that it is displayed correctly on different screen sizes and orientations. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement a responsive video ad integration using aspect ratio widgets in Flutter.

## Understanding Aspect Ratio in Flutter

In Flutter, you can control the aspect ratio using the `AspectRatio` widget. This widget allows you to define a specific ratio, such as 16:9, and automatically adjusts the width and height of the child widget accordingly. By using this widget, you can ensure that the video ad maintains its correct proportions on various devices.

## Integrating Video Ads

To integrate video ads into your Flutter application, follow these steps:

### 1. Import the necessary packages

Ensure that you have the appropriate packages installed in your `pubspec.yaml` file. You will need the `flutter_inappwebview` package to display video ads within the application.

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_inappwebview: ^5.3.2
```

### 2. Create an Aspect Ratio widget

Wrap your video ad widget with an `AspectRatio` widget. Set the aspect ratio to the desired value, such as 16:9 or any other appropriate ratio for your video ad.

```dart
AspectRatio(
  aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
  child: YourVideoAdWidget(),
),
```

### 3. Load the video ad URL

Use the `flutter_inappwebview` package to load the video ad URL into a webview. You may need to consult the package's documentation for specific instructions on how to load the URL.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_inappwebview/flutter_inappwebview.dart';

// ...

InAppWebView(
  initialUrl: 'YOUR_VIDEO_AD_URL',
),
```

### 4. Handle video ad events

Listen to video ad events, such as when the video finishes playing or if any errors occur. You can perform actions based on these events, such as showing another ad or navigating to a different screen.

```dart
InAppWebView(
  // ...

  onLoadStop: (controller, url) {
    // Perform actions when the ad finishes loading
  },

  onProgressChanged: (controller, progress) {
    // Track progress or show loading indicator
  },

  // ...
),
```

That's it! With these simple steps, you can integrate responsive video ads into your Flutter application using aspect ratio widgets. Remember to test your implementation on different devices and orientations to ensure a consistent user experience.
