When building a Flutter app with a page view, it is often useful to have a custom page indicator that visually represents the current page position. Flutter provides a powerful widget called `CustomPaint` that allows you to create custom shapes and drawings. In combination with the `CustomClipper` class, you can easily create a custom page indicator that fits your app's design.

Here's how you can create a custom page indicator using `CustomClipper` in Flutter:

1. Start by creating a new Flutter project and open the main.dart file.

2. Remove the default `Center` widget and replace it with a `PageView` widget. 

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Custom Page Indicator'),
        ),
        body: PageView(
          children: [
            Container(
              color: Colors.red,
            ),
            Container(
              color: Colors.green,
            ),
            Container(
              color: Colors.blue,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Next, create a new `CustomClipper` class that will be responsible for drawing the custom indicator shape. This class should extend the `CustomClipper<Path>` class. 

```dart
class CustomIndicatorClipper extends CustomClipper<Path> {
  @override
  Path getClip(Size size) {
    Path path = Path();
    // Implement your custom indicator shape here
    return path;
  }

  @override
  bool shouldReclip(CustomClipper<Path> oldClipper) => false;
}
```

4. Inside the `getClip` method of your custom clipper class, you can use the `Path` class to define your custom shape. For example, you can create a rounded rectangle shape by using the `addRRect` method of the `Path` class.

```dart
Path path = Path();
path.addRRect(RRect.fromRectAndRadius(
    Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, size.width, size.height),
    Radius.circular(size.height / 2)));
return path;
```

5. Now you can use your custom clipper class in the `CustomPaint` widget inside the `build` method of your app. This widget will draw the custom shape on top of your `PageView`.

```dart
body: Stack(
  children: [
    PageView(
      children: [
        Container(
          color: Colors.red,
        ),
        Container(
          color: Colors.green,
        ),
        Container(
          color: Colors.blue,
        ),
      ],
    ),
    Positioned(
      bottom: 20,
      left: 0,
      right: 0,
      child: CustomPaint(
        painter: CustomIndicatorClipper(),
      ),
    ),
  ],
),
```

6. Run your app, and you will see the custom page indicator at the bottom of the screen. You can customize the shape, size, color, and position of the indicator by modifying the `CustomClipper` class.

By using the `CustomClipper` class in combination with `CustomPaint`, you can create a wide variety of custom shapes and drawings in Flutter. This allows you to build unique and visually appealing user interfaces for your app.
