GraphQL is an open-source query language for APIs that allows developers to request and receive only the data they need. It provides a more efficient and flexible way of fetching data from APIs compared to traditional RESTful APIs.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to implement GraphQL in Flutter server-side rendering (SSR) applications. Flutter SSR, powered by frameworks like Angel and Aqueduct, enables us to build server-rendered Flutter applications that can be rendered on the server and sent to the client as HTML.

## Setting Up GraphQL in Flutter Server-Side Rendering

To get started, we need to install the required packages for implementing GraphQL in our Flutter SSR application. Open your application's `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:

```dart
dependencies:
  graphql_flutter: ^5.0.0
  graphql_flutter_simple_auth: ^1.0.0
```
**#flutter #graphql**

The `graphql_flutter` package is the main package we need for working with GraphQL in Flutter. It provides widgets and utilities for making GraphQL queries and mutations. The `graphql_flutter_simple_auth` package is an optional package that provides authentication functionality for GraphQL requests.

After adding the dependencies, run `flutter pub get` to fetch and download the packages.

## Implementing GraphQL Queries in Flutter SSR

Once we have the GraphQL packages set up, we can start implementing GraphQL queries in our Flutter SSR application. Here's an example of a simple Flutter SSR application that utilizes GraphQL:

```dart
import 'package:angel_framework/angel_framework.dart';
import 'package:graphql_flutter/graphql_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  var app = Angel();
  var appSecret = 'your_app_secret';

  await app.configure(ApplicationConfiguration(
    domain: 'https://api.example.com/graphql',
    secrets: {'appSecret': appSecret},
  ));

  app.fallback(graphqlEndpointHandler(app, appSecret));

  await app.startServer('localhost', 3000);
}

RequestHandler graphqlEndpointHandler(Angel app, String appSecret) {
  var link = HttpLink('https://api.example.com/graphql');
  var authLink = AuthLink(
    getToken: () async => 'Bearer ' + appSecret,
  );
  var linkWithAuth = authLink.concat(link);

  var client = GraphQLClient(
    cache: InMemoryCache(),
    link: linkWithAuth,
  );

  return (RequestContext req, ResponseContext res) async {
    var query = '''
      query {
        posts {
          id
          title
          content
        }
      }
    ''';

    var result = await client.query(QueryOptions(documentNode: gql(query)));

    return res.render('index', {'posts': result.data['posts']});
  };
}
```

In the example above, we set up the GraphQL endpoint and authenticate the request using the `appSecret`. We then create a `GraphQLClient` instance with the specified endpoint and authentication header.

Next, we define a GraphQL query and execute it using the `client.query` method. The response data is rendered using the `res.render` method.

## Conclusion

Implementing GraphQL in Flutter SSR applications allows us to take advantage of GraphQL's efficient data fetching capabilities. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily integrate GraphQL into your Flutter SSR application.

Remember to install the required packages, set up the GraphQL endpoint, and use the `client.query` method to fetch data from the server. Happy coding!
