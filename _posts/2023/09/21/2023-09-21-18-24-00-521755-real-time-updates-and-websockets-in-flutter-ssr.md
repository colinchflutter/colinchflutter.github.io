In today's fast-paced digital world, real-time updates have become a crucial feature for many applications. Flutter SSR (Server Side Rendering) is a powerful framework that allows developers to build server-rendered applications using the Flutter framework. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement real-time updates using websockets in Flutter SSR.

## What are Websockets?

Websockets are a communication protocol that allows real-time bidirectional communication between a client and a server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, where the client initiates the communication, websockets enable the server to push data to the client whenever it is available, providing a seamless and efficient communication channel.

## Implementing Websockets in Flutter SSR

To implement websockets in a Flutter SSR application, we will use the `web_socket_channel` package. This package provides a high-level API for working with websockets in Dart, making it easier to establish and manage websocket connections.

**Step 1: Add Dependencies**

First, we need to add the `web_socket_channel` package to our pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  web_socket_channel: ^2.0.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

**Step 2: Establish a WebSocket Connection**

To establish a websocket connection, we can create an instance of `WebSocketChannel` and provide the websocket URL:

```dart
import 'package:web_socket_channel/web_socket_channel.dart';

final channel = WebSocketChannel.connect(Uri.parse('wss://example.com/ws'));
```

Replace the URL with the actual websocket URL to connect to the server.

**Step 3: Listening for Updates**

We can listen for updates from the server by subscribing to the stream provided by the websocket channel. In Flutter SSR, we can use a `StreamBuilder` widget to automatically update our UI when new data arrives:

```dart
StreamBuilder(
  stream: channel.stream,
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    // Handle snapshot data
    if (snapshot.hasData) {
      // Update UI with new data
    }
    return Container();
  },
)
```

**Step 4: Sending Data to the Server**

To send data to the server, we can use the `sink` provided by the websocket channel:

```dart
channel.sink.add('Hello server!');
```

Replace `'Hello server!'` with the actual data you want to send.

**Step 5: Closing the Connection**

Finally, remember to close the websocket connection when it is no longer needed:

```dart
channel.sink.close();
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have seen how to implement real-time updates using websockets in Flutter SSR. With the `web_socket_channel` package, establishing a websocket connection and handling real-time data is straightforward. By harnessing the power of Flutter SSR and websockets, you can build applications that provide real-time updates, enhancing the overall user experience.
