Flutter is a powerful framework for building beautiful and responsive user interfaces across multiple platforms. With the introduction of Flutter SSR (Server Side Rendering), we now have the ability to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

In this blog post, we will explore how to create a responsive UI layout in Flutter SSR using the Flutter layout widgets and media queries.

## What is Responsive Layout?

A responsive layout refers to a user interface design that adjusts and adapts to different screen sizes and orientations. This ensures that the application looks and functions well on various devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

## Using Flutter Layout Widgets

Flutter provides a set of layout widgets that help us create flexible and responsive UIs. These widgets automatically handle the positioning and resizing of the UI elements based on the available screen space.

Let's take a look at some of the commonly used Flutter layout widgets:

1. **Container Widget**: The `Container` widget is a versatile widget that allows you to specify the height, width, padding, margin, and alignment of its child widget.

2. **Row and Column Widgets**: The `Row` and `Column` widgets are used to arrange child widgets horizontally and vertically, respectively. They automatically handle the distribution of space among the children.

3. **Flexible and Expanded Widgets**: These widgets are used inside `Row` and `Column` to define flexible and expandable children. They allow the child widgets to take up the available space proportionally.

4. **ListView Widget**: The `ListView` widget is used to create scrollable lists of variable-length. It automatically adjusts its height based on the number of items and the available screen space.

## Using Media Queries for Responsive Design

Media queries are an essential tool in creating responsive UI layouts in Flutter SSR. They allow us to conditionally style and position our UI elements based on the screen size and orientation.

Flutter provides the `MediaQuery` class to access the current media query information. We can use it to obtain properties like screen width, height, orientation, etc.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates the usage of media queries in Flutter SSR:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final Size screenSize = MediaQuery.of(context).size;
  final bool isPortrait = screenSize.height > screenSize.width;

  return Container(
    width: screenSize.width,
    height: screenSize.height,
    child: isPortrait
        ? Text('Portrait Layout')
        : Text('Landscape Layout'),
  );
}
```

In the above code, we are obtaining the screen size using `MediaQuery.of(context).size`. Then, we use the condition `isPortrait` to check if the device is in portrait or landscape mode and display the respective UI based on that.

## Conclusion

Creating responsive UI layouts in Flutter SSR is a breeze with the help of layout widgets and media queries. By using these tools effectively, we can ensure that our applications look and function great on different screen sizes and orientations.
