Flutter SSR (Server Side Rendering) allows developers to build web applications using Flutter and run them on the server side. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement file uploads and downloads in a Flutter SSR application.

## File Uploads

To implement file uploads in Flutter SSR, we can use the `http` package to make HTTP requests to our backend server. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to upload a file:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:http_parser/http_parser.dart';

void uploadFile() async {
  var uri = Uri.parse('https://your-backend-api.com/upload');

  var request = http.MultipartRequest('POST', uri);

  var file = await http.MultipartFile.fromPath(
    'file',
    '/path/to/file.txt',
    contentType: MediaType('text', 'plain'),
  );

  request.files.add(file);

  var response = await request.send();

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    print('File uploaded successfully');
  }
}
```

In this example, we are creating a `MultipartRequest` and adding the file to be uploaded. We then send the request and check the response status code to ensure the file was uploaded successfully.

## File Downloads

To implement file downloads in Flutter SSR, we can utilize the `url_launcher` package to open a file in the browser. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to download a file:

```dart
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';

void downloadFile(String fileUrl) async {
  if (await canLaunch(fileUrl)) {
    await launch(fileUrl);
  } else {
    throw 'Could not launch $fileUrl';
  }
}
```

In this example, we use the `launch` method from the `url_launcher` package to open the file URL in the browser. We first check if the platform supports launching URL schemes and then launch the file URL.

## Conclusion

Implementing file uploads and downloads in Flutter SSR is straightforward. By using the appropriate packages and methods, you can easily handle file operations within your application. With these features, you can create more interactive and dynamic web applications using Flutter SSR.
