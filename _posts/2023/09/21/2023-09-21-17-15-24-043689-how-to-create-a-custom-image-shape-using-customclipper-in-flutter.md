In Flutter, you can easily create custom shapes for your images using the `CustomClipper` class. This allows you to define a custom clipping path to achieve various shapes like circles, triangles, or any other shape of your choice. Let's go through the steps to create a custom image shape using `CustomClipper` in Flutter.

## Step 1: Set up a new Flutter project

First, create a new Flutter project by running the following command in your terminal:

```dart
flutter create custom_image_shape
```

## Step 2: Add dependencies

Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_svg: ^0.22.0
```
Save the file and run `flutter pub get` to fetch the added dependencies.

## Step 3: Create a new Dart file

Next, create a new Dart file `custom_image_shape.dart` and replace the existing code with the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_svg/flutter_svg.dart';

class CustomImageShape extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Custom Image Shape'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ClipPath(
          clipper: MyCustomClipper(),
          child: SvgPicture.asset(
            'assets/images/image.svg',
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
            fit: BoxFit.cover,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyCustomClipper extends CustomClipper<Path> {
  @override
  Path getClip(Size size) {
    final path = Path();
    path.moveTo(size.width * 0.5, 0);
    path.lineTo(size.width, size.height * 0.5);
    path.lineTo(size.width * 0.5, size.height);
    path.lineTo(0, size.height * 0.5);
    path.close();
    return path;
  }

  @override
  bool shouldReclip(covariant CustomClipper<Path> oldClipper) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Add SVG image

Create a new folder called `assets` in the project root directory. Inside the `assets` folder, create another folder called `images`. Place your SVG image file inside the `images` folder. 

Remember to update the `SvgPicture.asset` path in `custom_image_shape.dart` with the correct path to your SVG image file.

## Step 5: Run the app

Finally, run the app on your preferred device or emulator by executing the following command:

```dart
flutter run
```

You should see your custom-shaped image displayed on the screen.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a custom image shape using `CustomClipper` in Flutter. Feel free to experiment with different shapes by modifying the `getClip` method in the `MyCustomClipper` class.
