Flutter provides various widgets and libraries to create beautiful and interactive user interfaces. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a custom shape image carousel using the `CustomClipper` widget in Flutter.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have Flutter installed on your system and have a basic understanding of Flutter.

## Steps to create a custom shape image carousel

### Step 1: Add required dependencies

Open your Flutter project in your favorite IDE, and navigate to the `pubspec.yaml` file. Add the following dependencies under the `dependencies` section:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  carousel_slider: ^4.0.0-nullsafety.0
```

Save the file and run the command `flutter pub get` to fetch the newly added dependencies.

### Step 2: Import required libraries

In the Dart file where you want to create the custom shape image carousel, import the following libraries:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:carousel_slider/carousel_slider.dart';
```

### Step 3: Create the image carousel widget

Below is the code to create the image carousel widget with custom shape:

```dart
class CustomShapeCarousel extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<Image> images;
  final double height;
  final double width;
  
  const CustomShapeCarousel({
    required this.images,
    required this.height,
    required this.width,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CarouselSlider(
      options: CarouselOptions(
        height: height,
        aspectRatio: width / height,
      ),
      items: images.map((image) {
        return ClipPath(
          clipper: ShapeBorderClipper(
            shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20.0),
            ),
          ),
          child: Container(
            child: image,
          ),
        );
      }).toList(),
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Implement the custom shape image carousel in your app

In your app's `build` method, use the `CustomShapeCarousel` widget and provide the required attributes:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // ...
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      // ...
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Custom Shape Carousel'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: CustomShapeCarousel(
            images: [
              Image.asset('assets/image1.jpg'),
              Image.asset('assets/image2.jpg'),
              Image.asset('assets/image3.jpg'),
            ],
            height: 200,
            width: 300,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Replace the `Image.asset` with your own image paths.

### Step 5: Run the app

Save the changes and run the app on your emulator or device using the command `flutter run`. You should now see your custom shape image carousel in action.
