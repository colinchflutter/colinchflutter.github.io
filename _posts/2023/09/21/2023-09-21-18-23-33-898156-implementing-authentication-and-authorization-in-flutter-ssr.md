## Why Authentication and Authorization?

Authentication ensures that only authenticated users can access certain features or data within the application. Authorization, on the other hand, defines what resources or actions a particular user is allowed to access based on their role or permissions.

## How to Implement Authentication and Authorization in Flutter SSR

To get started, we need to set up the necessary libraries and packages. We will be using the Flutter web framework, along with the following dependencies:

1. [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio): A powerful HTTP client for making API requests.
2. [Shared Preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences): For storing and retrieving user authentication tokens.

Let's define our authentication and authorization logic step by step:

1. **Implement User Login**

To authenticate users, we need to provide a login page where users can enter their credentials. We can use the Flutter `TextField` widget to capture the username and password inputs. On form submission, we can make an API request to the server for user authentication using Dio.

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';

void authenticateUser(String username, String password) async {
  try {
    Response response = await Dio().post(
      'https://example.com/login',
      data: {'username': username, 'password': password},
    );
    
    // Store authentication token in the device using shared preferences
    String authToken = response.data['token'];
    // Store authToken in shared preferences
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle authentication error
  }
}

```

2. **Implement Protected Routes**

To implement authorization and protect specific routes in our Flutter SSR application, we can use a higher-order function that checks if the user is authenticated and authorized before allowing access to the protected route. Here is an example implementation:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

Future<bool> isUserAuthenticated() async {
  SharedPreferences preferences = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  String authToken = preferences.getString('authToken');
  return authToken != null;
}

void handleProtectedRoute(BuildContext context) async {
  bool isAuthenticated = await isUserAuthenticated();

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/login');
  } else {
    // Render the protected route
  }
}
```

3. **Intercept and Validate Requests**

To authorize requests made by authenticated users in a Flutter SSR application, we can use Dio's Interceptors. Interceptors allow us to intercept and modify requests before they are sent to the server. We can add an authorization header containing the authentication token.

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

void configInterceptors() async {
  Dio dio = Dio();
  SharedPreferences preferences = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  String authToken = preferences.getString('authToken');

  dio.interceptors.add(
    InterceptorsWrapper(
      onRequest: (Options options) {
        options.headers['Authorization'] = 'Bearer $authToken';
        return options;
      },
    ),
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement authentication and authorization in a Flutter SSR application. By setting up user login, protecting routes, and intercepting requests, we can create a secure and reliable authentication and authorization system in our Flutter application.
