In any application, performance plays a vital role in providing a smooth and seamless user experience. When it comes to server-side rendering (SSR) in Flutter, implementing lazy loading and code splitting can significantly improve the performance of your application.

Lazy loading and code splitting are techniques used to load only the necessary parts of your application when they are needed, reducing the initial load time and improving the overall performance. In Flutter SSR, we can achieve this by leveraging the `flutter_bloc` library and its support for lazy loading and code splitting.

## Lazy Loading

Lazy loading allows us to load components or modules of our application only when they are actually needed. This is particularly useful when dealing with large applications that have a lot of components or complex modules.

To implement lazy loading in Flutter SSR, you can use the `flutter_bloc` library along with the `Lazybloc` class, which provides support for loading a bloc lazily.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';

class MyLazyBloc extends LazyBloc<MyEvent, MyState> {
  MyLazyBloc() : super(MyState());

  @override
  Stream<MyState> loadBloc() async* {
    // Load the necessary data or initialize the bloc
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));

    // Emit the initial state or load the state from the cache
    yield MyState();
  }
}

class MyState {}

class MyEvent {}

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyWidget({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocProvider(
      create: (_) => MyLazyBloc(),
      child: BlocBuilder<MyLazyBloc, MyState>(
        builder: (context, state) {
          // Render your widget based on the state
          return Container();
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the example above, we define a `MyLazyBloc` class that extends `LazyBloc`. The `loadBloc` method is overridden to load the necessary data or initialize the bloc when it's requested. The `MyWidget` renders the widget tree based on the state of the lazy bloc.

## Code Splitting

Code splitting involves splitting your application's code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on-demand. This helps in reducing the initial load time and allows users to interact with the application sooner.

To implement code splitting in Flutter SSR, you can use the `flutter_bloc` library along with the `BlocBuilder` class, which supports lazy loading and dynamic module loading.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyWidget({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocBuilder<MyLazyBloc, MyState>(
      builder: (context, state) {
        // Load or render different parts of your UI based on the state
        return state.isLoading ? CircularProgressIndicator() : SomeOtherWidget();
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In the example above, we use the `BlocBuilder` to dynamically load or render different parts of the UI based on the state received from the lazy bloc. For example, we show a `CircularProgressIndicator` when the `isLoading` flag is true.

## Conclusion

Implementing lazy loading and code splitting in Flutter SSR can greatly improve the performance of your application by reducing the initial load time and loading only the necessary parts on-demand. Utilizing the `flutter_bloc` library and its support for lazy loading and dynamic module loading makes implementing these techniques straightforward.
