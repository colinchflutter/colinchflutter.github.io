As a developer, you often need to work with time and date in your Flutter applications. Whether you need to display the current time, calculate a future date, or format a timestamp, having the right set of extensions can greatly simplify your code and improve your productivity.

In this article, we will explore some of the most useful time and date manipulation extensions available for Flutter. These extensions will help you perform common time-related tasks with ease.

## flutter_native_time

Hashtag: #FlutterExtensions #TimeManipulation

The `flutter_native_time` extension provides a set of native time and date manipulation functions for Flutter. It leverages the platform's native capabilities to ensure accuracy and performance.

To use `flutter_native_time`, you first need to add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_native_time: ^1.0.0
```

Once you have added the package, you can use the extension to perform various operations. Here are some examples:

### Get Current Date and Time

```dart
import 'package:flutter_native_time/flutter_native_time.dart';

DateTime currentDateTime = DateTime.now().toNativeDateTime();
```

### Calculate Future Date

```dart
DateTime now = DateTime.now().toNativeDateTime();
DateTime futureDate = now.add(Duration(days: 7));
```

### Format Date and Time

```dart
DateTime datetime = DateTime.now().toNativeDateTime();
String formattedDateTime = datetime.format('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss');
```

## Jiffy

```

Once you have added the package, you can start using Jiffy to manipulate dates. Here are some examples:

DateTime currentDateTime = Jiffy().dateTime;
```

DateTime futureDate = Jiffy().add(duration: Duration(days: 7)).dateTime;
```

```dart
DateTime datetime = Jiffy().dateTime;
String formattedDateTime = Jiffy(datetime).format('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss');
```
