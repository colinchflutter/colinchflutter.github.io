If you're developing a Flutter application that requires email integration, you're in luck! There are several extensions available that allow you to easily integrate email inbox functionality and Gmail integration into your Flutter app. In this blog post, we'll explore two popular extensions: `flutter_inbox` and `flutter_gmail`.

## flutter_inbox

The `flutter_inbox` extension provides a simple way to display and manage an email inbox within your Flutter app. It offers features such as fetching and displaying emails, marking emails as read or unread, archiving and deleting emails, and more.

To get started with `flutter_inbox`, you can add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_inbox: ^1.0.0
```

After adding the dependency, you can import `flutter_inbox` into your Flutter project:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_inbox/flutter_inbox.dart';
```

Now, you can use the various methods and widgets provided by `flutter_inbox` to integrate email inbox functionality into your app. For example, you can use the `InboxListView` widget to display a list of emails:

```dart
InboxListView(
  emails: yourEmailsList,
  itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index, Email email) {
    return ListTile(
      title: Text(email.subject),
      subtitle: Text(email.sender),
      // Add more widgets to display email details
    );
  },
)
```

## flutter_gmail

If you specifically need Gmail integration in your Flutter app, `flutter_gmail` is a great choice. It provides APIs to authenticate with Gmail, fetch emails, send emails, and perform various other operations.

To use `flutter_gmail`, add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_gmail: ^1.0.0
```

Before using `flutter_gmail`, you'll need to set up API credentials for Gmail. Refer to the package documentation for details on obtaining and configuring the credentials.

Once you have the credentials, you can import `flutter_gmail` into your Flutter project:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_gmail/flutter_gmail.dart';
```

Now, you can use the `flutter_gmail` APIs to interact with Gmail. For example, to fetch emails from the user's inbox, you can use the `GmailAPI().getMessages()` method:

```dart
GmailAPI().getMessages().then((messages) {
  // Process the fetched emails
});
```

These extensions provide powerful email inbox and Gmail integration capabilities for your Flutter app. Whether you need to display an email inbox, manage emails, or perform operations with Gmail, `flutter_inbox` and `flutter_gmail` have got you covered!
