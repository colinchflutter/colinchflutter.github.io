In today's digital landscape, websites and applications need to be designed to adapt and provide an optimal user experience across different devices. With the increasing variety of screen sizes and resolutions, it is crucial to ensure that your content and design adjust accordingly.

One way to achieve this adaptive behavior is by using the `MediaQuery` class in programming languages like **JavaScript** or **Dart** (for Flutter). `MediaQuery` allows you to retrieve information about the current device's viewport and adjust your UI accordingly.

## Using MediaQuery for Adaptive Design

To start using `MediaQuery`, you first need to import it into your code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

Next, you can access the `MediaQuery` instance by calling the `of` method on the `context`:

```dart
MediaQueryData mediaQueryData = MediaQuery.of(context);
```

Once you have access to the `mediaQueryData`, you can utilize its properties to tailor your design. Below are a few commonly used properties:

- `mediaQueryData.size`: This property provides the viewport size of the device in logical pixels. You can make design decisions based on the available width and height.
- `mediaQueryData.orientation`: This property indicates the current orientation of the device. You can adjust your UI based on whether it is in portrait or landscape mode.
- `mediaQueryData.devicePixelRatio`: The device pixel ratio determines the pixel density of the device's screen. You can use this to scale your UI elements accordingly.

## Example: Adapting App Layout for Different Devices

Let's say you are building a mobile app and want to adapt the layout based on the device type. You can achieve this by using `MediaQuery` as shown in the example code below:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final mediaQueryData = MediaQuery.of(context);
    final deviceType = getDeviceType(mediaQueryData);

    Widget buildLayout() {
      if (deviceType == DeviceType.mobile) {
        // Render mobile layout
        return MobileLayout();
      } else if (deviceType == DeviceType.tablet) {
        // Render tablet layout
        return TabletLayout();
      } else {
        // Default to desktop layout
        return DesktopLayout();
      }
    }

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Adaptive App'),
        ),
        body: buildLayout(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

enum DeviceType {
  mobile,
  tablet,
  desktop,
}

DeviceType getDeviceType(MediaQueryData mediaQueryData) {
  final orientation = mediaQueryData.orientation;
  final deviceSize = mediaQueryData.size.shortestSide;

  if (orientation == Orientation.portrait && deviceSize < 600) {
    return DeviceType.mobile;
  } else if (deviceSize < 960) {
    return DeviceType.tablet;
  } else {
    return DeviceType.desktop;
  }
}
```

In the above example, we define a function called `getDeviceType` that determines the device type based on the orientation and device size. We use this function to choose the appropriate layout widget to render.

By leveraging the power of `MediaQuery`, your app can adapt to different devices and provide an optimized user experience.

Remember, it's essential to test your app on various devices and screen sizes to ensure that it behaves as expected. Additionally, always keep in mind the best practices for responsive design to provide a seamless and pleasant user experience across all devices.
