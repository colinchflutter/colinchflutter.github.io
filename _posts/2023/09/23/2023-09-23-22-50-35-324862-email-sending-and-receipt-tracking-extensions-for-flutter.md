With the immense popularity of mobile applications, sending and tracking emails within apps has become a common requirement. Flutter, a cross-platform framework, offers various extensions and plugins that enable seamless integration of email sending and receipt tracking functionalities in your Flutter apps. In this article, we will explore some of the popular extensions available and how you can leverage them in your Flutter projects.

## 1. `mailer` Extension

The `mailer` extension is a popular choice for sending emails from Flutter apps. It provides a simple and straightforward way to send emails using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) servers. To integrate it into your project, you can simply add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  mailer: ^3.0.0
```

Once you have added the dependency, you can start sending emails by configuring SMTP settings, composing the email, and calling the `send` method. Here is an example code snippet to send an email using the `mailer` extension:

```dart
import 'package:mailer/mailer.dart';
import 'package:mailer/smtp_server.dart';

void sendEmail() async {
  final smtpServer = SmtpServer('smtp.example.com',
      username: 'your_email@example.com', password: 'your_password');

  final message = Message()
    ..from = Address('your_email@example.com')
    ..recipients.add('recipient@example.com')
    ..subject = 'Hello from Flutter'
    ..text = 'This is the body of the email.';

  try {
    final sendReport = await send(message, smtpServer);
    print('Email sent: ${sendReport.sent}');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e');
  }
}
```

Feel free to explore the `mailer` package documentation for more advanced usage and configuration options.

## 2. `fluent_smtp` Extension

If you prefer a more sophisticated email-sending solution, you can consider using the `fluent_smtp` extension. This extension provides a high-level API to send emails with advanced features like attachments, HTML content, and email templates. To add the `fluent_smtp` extension to your Flutter project, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluent_smtp: ^0.1.0
```

Once added, you can send emails using various methods provided by the `fluent_smtp` extension. Here's an example code snippet to send an email using `fluent_smtp`:

```dart
import 'package:fluent_smtp/fluent_smtp.dart';

void sendEmail() async {
  final smtpClient = SmtpClient(
    SmtpOptions(
      host: 'smtp.example.com',
      port: 587,
      username: 'your_email@example.com',
      password: 'your_password',
      ssl: false,
    ),
  );

  final email = Email(
    subject: 'Hello from Flutter',
    recipients: ['recipient@example.com'],
    isHTML: false,
    body: 'This is the body of the email.',
  );

  try {
    await smtpClient.send(email);
    print('Email sent successfully');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e');
  }
}
```

This is just a basic example to get you started. Check out the documentation of the `fluent_smtp` package for more advanced usage, such as adding attachments or sending HTML emails.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the `mailer` and `fluent_smtp` extensions, you can seamlessly integrate these functionalities into your Flutter projects. Whether you need a simple email sending solution or a more advanced one with attachments and HTML content, these extensions have got you covered.
