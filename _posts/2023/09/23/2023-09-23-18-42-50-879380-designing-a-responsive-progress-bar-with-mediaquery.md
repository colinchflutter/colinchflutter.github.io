## Introduction

In today's digital world, **responsive design** has become a crucial aspect of web development. To ensure an optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes, it is important to adapt the layout and elements accordingly. In this blog post, we will explore how to design a responsive progress bar using MediaQuery.

## What is a Progress Bar?

A progress bar is a graphical element that indicates the completion progress of a task or process. It is commonly used to visually represent the percentage of work done or an indication of how much time is left until completion. In this tutorial, we will focus on creating a horizontal progress bar.

## Designing the Progress Bar

To design the responsive progress bar, we will be using HTML, CSS, and MediaQuery. Let's start by creating the HTML structure for the progress bar:

```html
<div class="progress-bar">
  <div class="progress"></div>
</div>
```

Next, we will add some basic CSS styles to set the initial appearance of the progress bar:

```css
.progress-bar {
  width: 100%;
  height: 20px;
  background-color: #ebebeb;
}

.progress {
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #2ecc71;
  width: 0%;
}
```

In the above code, we have set the width and height of the progress bar container (`progress-bar`) and the initial width of the progress indicator (`progress`) as `0%` to indicate no progress.

## Making the Progress Bar Responsive

To make the progress bar responsive, we will use `MediaQuery` to change the size of the progress bar based on the screen size. Let's take a look at an example of how to do this with CSS:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .progress-bar {
    height: 10px;
  }
}
```

In the above code, we are using `MediaQuery` to set the height of the progress bar to `10px` when the screen size is less than or equal to `768px`. This allows the progress bar to adjust dynamically based on the available screen space.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to design a responsive progress bar using `MediaQuery`. By leveraging the power of `MediaQuery`, we can create a visually appealing progress bar that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures an optimal user experience and enhances the overall usability of your web application.

Remember to test your progress bar on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it behaves as expected. Keep experimenting and exploring different design techniques to create beautiful and functional user interfaces.
