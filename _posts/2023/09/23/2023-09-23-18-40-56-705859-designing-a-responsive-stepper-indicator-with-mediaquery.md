In modern web design, it is essential to create responsive components that adapt to different screen sizes. One common component is a stepper indicator, which helps guide users through a multi-step process.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to design a responsive stepper indicator using the `MediaQuery` feature in CSS.

## Understanding MediaQuery

`MediaQuery` is a CSS feature that allows web developers to apply different styles based on various characteristics of the output device. It enables us to define different style rules depending on factors like screen size, resolution, orientation, and more.

By leveraging `MediaQuery` in our design, we can ensure that our stepper indicator looks great on all devices, regardless of their screen sizes.

## Steps to Create a Responsive Stepper Indicator

Let's dive into the steps required to create a responsive stepper indicator using `MediaQuery`:

1. Define the basic structure: Start by creating the HTML structure for the stepper. Each step will be represented by an individual element.

   ```html
   <div class="stepper">
     <div class="step">Step 1</div>
     <div class="step">Step 2</div>
     <div class="step">Step 3</div>
   </div>
   ```

2. Apply styles for the stepper: Initially, apply the basic styles to the stepper element.

   ```css
   .stepper {
     display: flex;
     justify-content: space-between;
   }

   .step {
     flex: 1;
     text-align: center;
     /* Add other styles as desired */
   }
   ```

3. Implement responsive behavior using MediaQuery: To design our stepper for different screen sizes, we can use `MediaQuery` to change the styles at specific breakpoints.

   ```css
   @media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
     .stepper {
       flex-direction: column;
     }

     .step {
       flex: none;
       /* Add other styles as desired */
     }
   }
   ```

4. Test and refine: Finally, test the stepper on various devices and screen sizes to ensure it looks and behaves as expected. Make any necessary adjustments to the styles and `MediaQuery` rules until you achieve the desired responsive behavior.

## Conclusion

Designing a responsive stepper indicator using `MediaQuery` is a great way to ensure your multi-step process remains user-friendly across different screen sizes. By leveraging the power of `MediaQuery`, you can adapt the styling of your stepper based on the device's characteristics.

Remember to test your design on multiple devices and refine it as needed to achieve a seamless user experience.
