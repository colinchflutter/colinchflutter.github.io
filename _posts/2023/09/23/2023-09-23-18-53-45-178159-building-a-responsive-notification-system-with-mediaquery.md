# Understanding MediaQuery

The `MediaQuery` class in HTML and CSS allows us to apply specific styles or behaviors based on the characteristics of the user's device. This can include properties such as screen size, orientation, resolution, and more.

By utilizing `MediaQuery`, we can create a notification system that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal user experience on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

# Step 1: Setting up the HTML structure

Let's start by creating the HTML structure for our notification system. We will use a simple `<div>` container that will hold the notification content.

```html
<div class="notification">
  <span class="message">New notification!</span>
  <button class="close">Close</button>
</div>
```

In the above code snippet, we have a `<span>` element to display the notification message and a `<button>` element to close the notification.

# Step 2: Applying CSS styles using MediaQuery

Now, let's apply CSS styles to our notification system. We will use `MediaQuery` to define different styles for different screen sizes.

```css
.notification {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  right: 20px;
  background-color: #eaeaea;
  padding: 10px;
  border-radius: 5px;
}

.notification .message {
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.notification .close {
  background-color: #f44336;
  color: #fff;
  border: none;
  padding: 5px 10px;
  border-radius: 3px;
}
```

In the above code snippet, we have defined styles for the notification container, message, and close button. These styles will be applied to all screen sizes.

# Step 3: Applying responsive styles using `MediaQuery`

Now, let's make our notification system responsive by adding different styles for different screen sizes. We can use the `MediaQuery` class to define these responsive styles.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  .notification {
    top: 10px;
    right: 10px;
    width: 80%;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  .notification {
    top: 15px;
    right: 15px;
    width: 60%;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 1025px) {
  .notification {
    top: 20px;
    right: 20px;
    width: 40%;
  }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we have defined responsive styles for three different screen sizes: up to 600 pixels, between 601 and 1024 pixels, and above 1025 pixels. The styles include changing the position, width, and padding of the notification container to ensure proper display on each screen size.

# Conclusion

By utilizing the `MediaQuery` class in HTML and CSS, we can easily create a responsive notification system that adapts to different screen sizes. This ensures that users receive notifications in a visually pleasing and user-friendly manner, no matter the device they are using.

Remember to test your notification system on various devices and screen sizes to ensure optimal user experience. Implementing a responsive notification system can greatly enhance the usability of your web application and improve user engagement.
