If you are building a mobile application with Flutter that involves accepting credit card payments, you may want to integrate credit card scanning and verification functionality to enhance the user experience and ensure the accuracy of the entered card details. In this blog post, we will explore some popular credit card scanning and verification extensions available for Flutter.

## 1. flutter_card_io

**#flutter #creditcard #scanning**

The `flutter_card_io` extension provides a simple and efficient way to scan credit cards using the device's camera. It integrates with the Card.io SDK, which supports scanning credit cards from different countries. Once a card is scanned, the extension provides the card information including the card number, cardholder name, expiration date, and CVV (Card Verification Value).

To use `flutter_card_io`, you can add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_card_io: ^1.1.0
```

After adding the dependency, you can simply import it in your Flutter code and use the provided widgets:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_card_io/flutter_card_io.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Credit Card Scanner')),
        body: Container(
          child: CardIOResponseScanner((CardIOResponse response) {
            print(response.cardNumber); // Access scanned card information
          }),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

With `flutter_card_io`, you can easily integrate credit card scanning into your Flutter app, streamlining the payment process for your users.

## 2. stripe_sdk

**#flutter #creditcard #verification**

The `stripe_sdk` extension allows you to securely validate credit card details without the need for a server-side implementation. It supports various features, including formatting the card number as it is typed, validating against the Luhn algorithm, and determining the card brand based on the entered number.

To integrate `stripe_sdk`, include it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  stripe_sdk: ^1.5.1
```

After adding the dependency, you can utilize the extension in your Flutter code:

```dart
import 'package:stripe_sdk/stripe_sdk.dart';
import 'package:stripe_sdk/ui/card_field.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final Stripe stripe = Stripe('YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY');

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Credit Card Verification')),
        body: Container(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
          child: Column(
            children: [
              CardField(
                stripe: stripe,
                numberHintText: 'Card Number',
                expirationHintText: 'Expiration Date',
                cvcHintText: 'CVC',
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () async {
                  try {
                    final Card card = await CardField.inputCard();
                    final PaymentMethod paymentMethod = await stripe.createPaymentMethod(CardParams(card: card));
                    print(paymentMethod.id); // Access payment method ID
                  } catch (e) {
                    print('Error: $e');
                  }
                },
                child: Text('Verify Card'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

With `stripe_sdk`, you can easily perform credit card verification in your Flutter app using the Stripe API.
