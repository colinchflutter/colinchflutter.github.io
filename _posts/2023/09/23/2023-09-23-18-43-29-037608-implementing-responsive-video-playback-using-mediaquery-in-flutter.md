## Enhancing the video playback experience for all devices

In today's digital age, where users consume a significant amount of video content on various devices, it is essential for mobile applications to provide a responsive video playback experience. With Flutter, we can achieve this by utilizing the `MediaQuery` widget.

Let's take a look at how we can implement responsive video playback in a Flutter application.

### Step 1: Add dependencies
First, ensure that you have added the necessary dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  video_player: ^2.1.6
  flutter_svg: ^0.22.0
```

The `video_player` package provides tools for playing videos, while `flutter_svg` allows us to display scalable vector graphics.

### Step 2: Create the video player widget
Create a new widget called `VideoPlayerWidget` that will handle video playback. Inside this widget, initialize a `VideoPlayerController` with the video source and handle its lifecycle using the `VideoPlayerControllerProvider`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';

class VideoPlayerWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  final String videoUrl;

  const VideoPlayerWidget({required this.videoUrl});

  @override
  _VideoPlayerWidgetState createState() => _VideoPlayerWidgetState();
}

class _VideoPlayerWidgetState extends State<VideoPlayerWidget> {
  late VideoPlayerController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = VideoPlayerController.network(widget.videoUrl)
      ..initialize().then((_) {
        setState(() {});
      });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    if (_controller.value.isInitialized) {
      return AspectRatio(
        aspectRatio: _controller.value.aspectRatio,
        child: VideoPlayer(_controller),
      );
    } else {
      return CircularProgressIndicator();
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Implement responsive video playback
In the parent widget where we want to display the video, we can now utilize `MediaQuery`. By obtaining the screen width, we can dynamically adjust the size of the video player widget.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class VideoPage extends StatelessWidget {
  final String videoUrl;

  const VideoPage({required this.videoUrl});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Video Playback'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Container(
          width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width * 0.8,  // Adjust according to your needs
          child: VideoPlayerWidget(videoUrl: videoUrl),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the example above, we set the width of the `VideoPlayerWidget` container to 80% of the screen width using `MediaQuery.of(context).size.width * 0.8`. You can adjust this value to suit your desired layout.

### Step 4: Use the responsive video player
Finally, navigate to `VideoPage` passing the video URL as a parameter:

```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => VideoPage(videoUrl: 'https://example.com/video.mp4'),
  ),
);
```

By following these steps, you can implement responsive video playback in your Flutter application. With the help of `MediaQuery`, the video player will adjust its size accordingly, providing an optimal viewing experience on different devices.

Remember, providing a responsive video playback experience is crucial to ensure that users can enjoy your app's content seamlessly on any device. #Flutter #ResponsiveVideoPlayback
