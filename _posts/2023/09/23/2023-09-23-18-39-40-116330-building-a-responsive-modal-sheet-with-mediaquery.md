In modern web development, creating responsive user interfaces is crucial to ensure a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. One common element used in web design is the modal sheet, which provides additional information or interaction options without leaving the current page. In this blog post, we will explore how to build a responsive modal sheet using the `MediaQuery` class in a web application.

## What is `MediaQuery`?

The `MediaQuery` class is part of many web development frameworks and libraries, such as React and Flutter, and is used to perform conditional rendering based on the device's screen size or orientation. By using `MediaQuery`, we can easily adapt our UI components to different viewport sizes and provide a responsive user experience.

## Creating the Modal Sheet Component

Let's start by creating a basic modal sheet component in JavaScript using React:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function ModalSheet() {
  return (
    <div className="modal-sheet">
      <h3>Modal Content</h3>
      <p>This is the content of the modal sheet.</p>
      {/* Additional content */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default ModalSheet;
```

Here, we have a simple component that renders a modal sheet with a title and some content. We can enhance this component to make it responsive by utilizing `MediaQuery`.

## Making the Modal Sheet Responsive

To make the modal sheet responsive, we need to define different styles for different screen sizes. We can accomplish this by using `MediaQuery` to conditionally apply CSS styles based on the device's viewport.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { MediaQuery } from 'your-web-framework'; // Import MediaQuery from your specific web framework

function ModalSheet() {
  return (
    <MediaQuery minWidth={768}>
      {(matches) => (
        <div className={`modal-sheet ${matches ? 'responsive' : ''}`}>
          <h3>Modal Content</h3>
          <p>This is the content of the modal sheet.</p>
          {/* Additional content */}
        </div>
      )}
    </MediaQuery>
  );
}

export default ModalSheet;
```

In this updated code, we wrap our modal sheet component with `MediaQuery`. The `minWidth` prop specifies the minimum viewport width at which the component should be rendered. The `matches` argument in the render function indicates whether the condition specified by `MediaQuery` is met. We can then use the `matches` value to conditionally apply a CSS class (`responsive`) to our modal sheet component.

## Conclusion

With the help of `MediaQuery`, we can easily create a responsive modal sheet that adapts to different screen sizes. By leveraging conditional rendering based on viewport characteristics, we can provide a consistent user experience across various devices. Building responsive UI components is crucial in today's web development landscape, and `MediaQuery` makes it easier than ever.
