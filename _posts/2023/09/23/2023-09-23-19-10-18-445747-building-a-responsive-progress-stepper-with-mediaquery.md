In today's blog post, we will learn how to build a responsive progress stepper using the `MediaQuery` class in a popular programming language. This progress stepper will adapt its layout and styling based on different screen sizes, offering a seamless user experience on various devices.

## Understanding the Concept

A progress stepper is a UI component that guides users through a multi-step process, indicating the current step and the overall progress made. It typically consists of a series of steps or milestones and allows users to track their progress and navigate between steps.

## Implementing the Responsive Progress Stepper

To implement a responsive progress stepper, we will utilize the `MediaQuery` class to dynamically adjust the layout and styling based on the available screen space. Let's dive into the code:

```programming-language
import MediaQuery from 'some-library';

function ProgressStepper() {
  const isSmallScreen = MediaQuery.matches('(max-width: 600px)');
  
  // Some logic to track current step and progress
  
  return (
    <div className={`progress-stepper ${isSmallScreen ? 'small-screen' : ''}`}>
      {/* Render the step components */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the above code snippet, we first import the `MediaQuery` class from a suitable library. We then define a functional component called `ProgressStepper`. Inside this component, we use the `matches` method of `MediaQuery` to check if the screen width is smaller than or equal to 600 pixels (`max-width: 600px`).

Based on the result of the media query check, we conditionally add the class `small-screen` to the parent `div` of our progress stepper. This class can be used to style and position the step components differently for smaller screens.

Make sure you have appropriate CSS styles for the `progress-stepper` class and `small-screen` class defined in your stylesheet to achieve the desired responsive layout.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the power of `MediaQuery`, we can easily create a responsive progress stepper that adapts to different screen sizes. This ensures an optimal user experience across various devices, allowing users to seamlessly navigate through a multi-step process.

Remember to keep the user in mind when designing and developing your progress stepper. Consider accessibility, usability, and a visually appealing design to provide users with a smooth and intuitive experience.
