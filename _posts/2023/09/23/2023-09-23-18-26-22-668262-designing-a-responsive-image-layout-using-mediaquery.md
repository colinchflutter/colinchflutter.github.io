In today's mobile-first world, designing websites with responsive layouts has become crucial. One common scenario is creating a responsive image layout that adjusts to different screen sizes and orientations. In this blog post, we will explore how to achieve this using the `MediaQuery` feature. 

## What is MediaQuery?

`MediaQuery` is a feature in CSS that allows us to define different styles for different media types or conditions. With `MediaQuery`, we can apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device or screen we are targeting. This includes properties like screen size, resolution, orientation, and more. 

## Steps to Create a Responsive Image Layout

To create a responsive image layout, follow these steps:

### Step 1: HTML Markup

First, let's create the HTML markup for our image layout. We will use a simple `<div>` to hold the images and provide a class or ID for styling purposes.

```html
<div class="image-layout">
    <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
    <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
    <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
</div>
```

### Step 2: CSS Styling

Next, we define the CSS styling for our image layout. We will use `flexbox` to arrange the images in a row, and then use `MediaQuery` to modify the layout based on different screen sizes.

```css
.image-layout {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.image-layout img {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    margin: 10px;
}

/* Apply different styles for screens smaller than 600px */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
    .image-layout img {
        width: 45%; /* Adjust the width to your preference */
        margin: 5px;
    }
}

/* Apply different styles for screens larger than 1200px */
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
    .image-layout img {
        width: 30%; /* Adjust the width to your preference */
        margin: 20px;
    }
}
```

In the CSS code snippet above, we specify a default style for the images. Then, using `MediaQuery`, we define different styles for screens smaller than 600px and screens larger than 1200px. These styles adjust the width and margins of the images to create a responsive image layout.

### Step 3: Apply CSS to your HTML

Finally, apply the CSS to your HTML by linking the CSS file or adding the styles inline (if preferred).
