## Introduction
NFC (Near Field Communication) is a wireless communication technology that allows devices to transfer data over short distances. It is commonly used for contactless payments, access control, and data sharing between devices. In this blog post, we will explore NFC support extensions for Flutter, a popular cross-platform framework for mobile app development.

## Why Use NFC in Flutter Apps?
Integrating NFC into Flutter apps can unlock a wide range of possibilities. Some of the use cases for NFC in Flutter apps include:
- **Contactless Payments**: You can enable users to make payments using their mobile devices by integrating NFC payment solutions into your app.
- **Access Control**: NFC can be used for implementing secure access control systems for buildings, vehicles, or even virtual keys.
- **Mobile Ticketing**: NFC tags can be used to validate tickets or pass credentials for events, transportation, etc.
- **Data Sharing**: NFC allows users to quickly share data between devices by simply tapping them together.
- **Smart IoT Integration**: NFC can be used to provide seamless interaction between smartphones and smart IoT devices.
