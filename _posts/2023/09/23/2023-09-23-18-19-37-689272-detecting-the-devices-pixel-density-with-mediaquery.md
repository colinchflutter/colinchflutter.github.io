Pixel density, also known as dots per inch (DPI) or pixels per inch (PPI), refers to the number of pixels that fit within a physical unit of length, typically an inch. Higher pixel density results in sharper and more detailed displays.

To detect the device's pixel density in CSS, we can use the `min-resolution` media feature along with the `dpi` unit. Here's an example:

```css
@media (min-resolution: 192dpi) {
  /* Styles for high pixel density screens (retina, high-density displays) */
  body {
    background-color: #f1f1f1;
    font-size: 16px;
  }
}

@media (min-resolution: 72dpi) {
  /* Styles for normal pixel density screens */
  body {
    background-color: #ffffff;
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}
```

In the code snippet above, we define different styles based on the minimum pixel density of the device. The first `@media` block targets devices with a pixel density of at least 192dpi (common for high-density displays like Retina). The second `@media` block targets devices with a pixel density of at least 72dpi (typical for normal screens).

By adjusting the CSS properties within each media query, we can optimize the website's appearance and readability based on the pixel density. For instance, we might want to increase the font size on high-density screens to ensure legibility.

Remember, detecting pixel density using `MediaQuery` is helpful for applying specific styles to different types of screens, but it's crucial to ensure your website's overall responsiveness and adaptability to various screen sizes as well.

So, harness the power of `MediaQuery` and create an enhanced user experience by optimizing your website for different pixel densities!
