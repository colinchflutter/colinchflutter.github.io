Are you looking to incorporate Bluetooth beacon scanning and proximity detection into your Flutter app? Look no further! In this blog post, we will explore two popular extensions that allow you to easily integrate these functionalities into your Flutter project.

## 1. Flutter Beacon

[Flutter Beacon](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_beacon) is a powerful Flutter plugin that enables you to scan for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and monitor their proximity. It provides a high-level API that simplifies the process of detecting beacons and retrieving their information.

To get started with Flutter Beacon, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_beacon: ^0.7.0
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package. Now, you can start using Flutter Beacon in your code.

To scan for beacons, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_beacon/flutter_beacon.dart';
```

Next, initialize the beacon scanning process:

```dart
initializeScanning();
```

Once initialized, you can start listening for beacon events:

```dart
final stream = beaconEvents.beaconBroadcast();
stream.listen((beacon) {
  // Handle beacon discovery and proximity updates
});
```

Flutter Beacon provides various methods to filter and process beacon data. You can extract information such as UUID, major, minor, distance, RSSI, and more from the detected beacons.

## 2. Proximity Beacon Plugin

[Proximity Beacon Plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/proximity_plugin) is another great option for integrating beacon scanning and proximity detection into your Flutter app. This plugin supports both Android and iOS platforms, making it a versatile choice for cross-platform development.

To add Proximity Beacon Plugin to your project, include the following dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  proximity_plugin: ^1.0.1
```

After adding the dependency, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package. Now, you can import and use Proximity Beacon Plugin in your Flutter codebase.

To start scanning for beacons, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:proximity_plugin/proximity_plugin.dart';
```

Next, initialize the beacon scanning process:

```dart
initScan();
```

To detect nearby beacons and receive proximity updates, use the `beaconEvents` stream:

```dart
proximityEvents.beaconEvents.listen((event) {
  // Handle beacon discovery and proximity updates
});
```

Proximity Beacon Plugin provides a variety of options for filtering and processing beacon data, including proximity range configurations and beacon type selection.

## Conclusion

With the Flutter Beacon and Proximity Beacon Plugin extensions, you can easily integrate Bluetooth beacon scanning and proximity detection features into your Flutter app. The provided APIs simplify the process of discovering beacons and monitoring their proximity, allowing you to create powerful location-based experiences.

Whether you choose Flutter Beacon or Proximity Beacon Plugin, incorporating Bluetooth beacon functionality into your Flutter app has never been easier. Happy coding!
