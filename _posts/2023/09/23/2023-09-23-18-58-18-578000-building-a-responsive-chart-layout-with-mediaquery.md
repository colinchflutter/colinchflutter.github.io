## What is `MediaQuery`?

The `MediaQuery` class in Flutter provides access to the current device's size, orientation, and other properties related to the device's display. It allows us to build responsive layouts by dynamically updating the UI based on the device's characteristics.

## Responsive Chart Layout

To create a responsive chart layout, we will use a `LayoutBuilder` widget along with `MediaQuery.of(context)` to determine the available space for the chart. This will allow our chart to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

Here's an example code snippet of how you can use `MediaQuery` to build a responsive chart layout:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class ResponsiveChartLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LayoutBuilder(
      builder: (BuildContext context, BoxConstraints constraints) {
        final double availableWidth = constraints.maxWidth;
        final double availableHeight = constraints.maxHeight;

        final double chartWidth = availableWidth * 0.8; // Adjust the width based on your desired ratio
        final double chartHeight = availableHeight * 0.6; // Adjust the height based on your desired ratio

        return Container(
          width: chartWidth,
          height: chartHeight,
          // Add chart rendering code here
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we first obtain the available width and height from the `BoxConstraints` provided by the `LayoutBuilder`. We then calculate the desired width and height for our chart layout based on the available space. Finally, we can use these calculated values to customize the size of the container that holds our chart.

## Conclusion

Building a responsive chart layout is crucial for creating a visually appealing and user-friendly application. With the help of `MediaQuery`, we can easily adapt our UI to different screen sizes and orientations. By using a `LayoutBuilder` along with `MediaQuery.of(context)`, we can determine the available space and adjust the chart layout accordingly.

Remember, a responsive layout improves the overall user experience by ensuring that the content is displayed optimally on different devices. So, embrace the power of `MediaQuery` and start building amazing responsive chart layouts in your Flutter apps.
