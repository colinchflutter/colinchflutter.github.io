Flutter is a popular cross-platform framework for building mobile, web, and desktop applications. While it provides a rich set of UI components and features, it may not have all the tools needed for advanced video editing and post-processing. Luckily, there are several extensions available for Flutter that can enhance your app with video editing capabilities. In this article, we will explore some popular video editing and post-processing extensions for Flutter.
