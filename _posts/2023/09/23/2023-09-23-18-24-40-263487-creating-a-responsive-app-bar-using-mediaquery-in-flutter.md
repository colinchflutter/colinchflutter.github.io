In this blog post, we will explore how to create a responsive app bar using the `MediaQuery` widget in Flutter. By utilizing `MediaQuery`, we can build app bars that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

## What is MediaQuery?

`MediaQuery` is a widget in Flutter that provides information about the current device's media properties, such as size and orientation. It allows us to build UI components that automatically adjust to various device configurations.

## Implementing a Responsive App Bar

To create a responsive app bar, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary Flutter packages:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

2. Create a `StatefulWidget` and its accompanying `State` class:

```dart
class MyAppBar extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppBarState createState() => _MyAppBarState();
}

class _MyAppBarState extends State<MyAppBar> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Your code goes here
  }
}
```

3. Inside the `build` method, use `MediaQuery` to determine the device's width:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final double screenWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
  
  // Your code goes here
}
```

4. Use the `screenWidth` variable to conditionally render different app bar styles based on the device's width:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final double screenWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;

  if (screenWidth < 600) {
    return AppBar(
      title: Text('Mobile App Bar'),
    );
  } else {
    return AppBar(
      title: Text('Desktop App Bar'),
    );
  }
}
```

5. Finally, integrate the `MyAppBar` widget into your Flutter app:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(
      appBar: MyAppBar(),
      // Your app's body goes here
    ),
  ));
}
```

## Conclusion

By utilizing `MediaQuery`, we can create app bars that adapt to the device's screen size. This allows our Flutter applications to provide a consistent and user-friendly experience across different devices.

Remember to test your app bar on various devices and orientations to ensure it functions as expected. Keep experimenting and customizing the app bar to suit your app's design and requirements.
